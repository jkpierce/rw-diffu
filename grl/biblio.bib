abstract = {We present a model of one-dimensional symmetric and asymmetric random walks. The model is applied to an experiment studying fluid transport in a rapidly rotating annulus. In the model, random walkers alternate between flights (steps of constant velocity) and sticking (pauses between flights). Flight time and sticking time probability distribution functions (PDFs) have power law decays: P(t) similar to t(-mu) and t(-nu) for flights and sticking, respectively. We calculate the dependence of the variance exponent gamma (sigma(2) similar to t(gamma)) on the PDF exponents mu and nu. For a broad distribution of flight times (mu {\textless}3), the motion is superdiffusive (1 {\textless}gamma {\textless}2), and the PDF has a divergent second moment, i.e., it is a Levy distribution. For a broad distribution of sticking times (nu {\textless}3), either superdiffusion or subdiffusion (gamma {\textless}1) can occur, with qualitative differences between symmetric and asymmetric walks. For narrow PDFs (mu 3, nu {\textgreater}3), normal diffusion (gamma = 1) is recovered. Predictions of the model are related to experimental observations of transport in a rotating annulus. The Eulerian velocity field is chaotic, yet it is still possible to distinguish between well-defined sticking events (particles trapped in vortices) and flights (particles making long excursions in a jet). The distribution of flight lengths is well described by a power law with a divergent second moment (Levy distribution). The observed transport is strongly asymmetric and is well described by the proposed model.},

abstract = {The beds of gravel-bed rivers commonly display distinct sorting patterns, which at length scales of {\~{}}. 0.1. 1 channel widths appear to form an organization of patches or facies. This paper explores alternatives to traditional visual facies mapping by investigating methods of patch delineation in which clustering analysis is applied to a high-resolution grid of spatial grain-size distributions (GSDs) collected during a flume experiment. Specifically, we examine four clustering techniques: 1) partitional clustering of grain-size distributions with the k-means algorithm (assigning each GSD to a type of patch based solely on its distribution characteristics), 2) spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering ("growing" patches by merging adjacent GSDs, thus generating a hierarchical structure of patchiness), 3) spectral clustering using Normalized Cuts (using the spatial distance between GSDs and the distribution characteristics to generate a matrix describing the similarity between all GSDs, and using the eigenvalues of this matrix to divide the bed into patches), and 4) fuzzy clustering with the fuzzy c-means algorithm (assigning each GSD a membership probability to every patch type). For each clustering method, we calculate metrics describing how well-separated cluster-average GSDs are and how patches are arranged in space. We use these metrics to compute optimal clustering parameters, to compare the clustering methods against each other, and to compare clustering results with patches mapped visually during the flume experiment.All clustering methods produced better-separated patch GSDs than the visually-delineated patches. Although they do not produce crisp cluster assignment, fuzzy algorithms provide useful information that can characterize the uncertainty of a location on the bed belonging to any particular type of patch, and they can be used to characterize zones of transition from one patch to another. The extent to which spatial information influences clustering leads to a trade-off between the quality of GSD separation between patch types and the spatial coherence of patches. Methods incorporating spatial information during the clustering process tended to produce a finite number of types of patches. As methods improve for collecting high-resolution grain size data, the approaches described here can be scaled up to field studies to better characterize the grain size heterogeneity of river beds. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Furthermore, improving the flow model based on the potential flow theory by introducing the effect of flow acceleration or deceleration which can be expressed by local variation of flow depth, the phase lag between bed shear stress and bed form has been estimated.

abstract = {Large wood along rivers influences entrainment, transport, and storage of mineral sediment and particulate organic matter. We review how wood alters sediment dynamics and explore patterns among volumes of in-stream wood, sediment storage, and residual pools for dispersed pieces of wood, logjams, and beaver dams. We hypothesized that: volume of sediment per unit area of channel stored in association with wood is inversely proportional to drainage area; the form of sediment storage changes downstream; sediment storage correlates with wood load; the residual volume of pools created in association with wood correlates inversely with drainage area; and volume of sediment stored behind beaver dams correlates with pond area. Lack of data from larger drainage areas limits tests of these hypotheses, but the analyses suggest that sediment volume correlates positively with drainage area and wood volume. The form of sediment storage in relation to wood appears to change downstream, with wedges of sediment upstream from jammed steps most prevalent in small, steep channels and more dispersed sediment storage in lower gradient channels. Pool volume correlates positively with wood volume and negatively with channel gradient. Sediment volume correlates well with beaver pond area. More abundant in-stream wood and beaver populations present historically equated to greater sediment storage within river corridors and greater residual pool volume. One implication of these changes is that protecting and re-introducing wood and beavers can be used to restore rivers. This review of the existing literature on wood and sediment dynamics highlights the lack of studies on larger rivers. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Lamb2008,
abstract = {Data from laboratory flumes and natural streams show that the critical Shields stress for initial sediment motion increases with channel slope, which indicates that particles of the same size are more stable on steeper slopes. This observation is contrary to standard models that predict reduced stability with increasing slope due to the added downstream gravitational force. Processes that might explain this discrepancy are explored using a simple force-balance model, including increased drag from channel walls and bed morphology, variable friction angles, grain emergence, flow aeration, and changes to the local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations. Surprisingly, increased drag due to changes in bed morphology does not appear to be the cause of the slope dependency because both the magnitude and trend of the critical Shields stress are similar for flume experiments and natural streams, and significant variations in bed morphology in flumes is unlikely. Instead, grain emergence and changes in local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations seem to be responsible for the slope dependency due to the coincident increase in the ratio of bed-roughness scale to flow depth (i.e., relative roughness). A model for the local velocity within the grain-roughness layer is proposed based on a 1-D eddy viscosity with wake mixing. In addition, the magnitude of near-bed turbulent fluctuations is shown to depend on the depth-averaged flow velocity and the relative roughness. Extension of the model to mixed grain sizes indicates that the coarser fraction becomes increasingly difficult to transport on steeper slopes.},

The latter reveals two distinct regions: a scaling region at small spatial lags and a saturation region at large scales. The scaling exponent H (a form of Hurst exponent) appears to be isotropic and universal for both manually created "unworked" gravel beds (H = 0.5) and natural water-worked gravel beds (H = 0.79). However, the gravel-bed roughness, in general, is not isotropic and should be characterized by three independent characteristic scales.

abstract = {The role played by the texture of the sediment supply on channel bed adjustments in gravel- bed rivers is poorly understood. To address this issue, an experimental campaign has been designed. Flume experiments lasting 96 h in a 9 m long, 0.60 m wide have been performed with different sand-gravel mix- tures as feed textures. The response of the surface texture has been found to be highly dependent on the grain size distribution of the feed. When the feed texture included gravel, the finest fractions of the sedi- ment supply infiltrate beneath the surface. Conversely, sand remains on the surface when the feed texture lacks gravel. This different textural response becomes obscured when water discharge increases. Further, the sediment transport rate approaches the feed rate differently depending on the content of gravel in the feed texture. When a small proportion of gravel is part of the feed texture, bed load transport rate asymp- totically approaches the feed rate. However, when a significant fraction of gravel is part of the feed grain size distribution, bed load transport rate approaches the feed rate by following an oscillatory path. These findings have been verified in terms of a one-dimensional numerical model. This modeling reveals that the higher the differences in mobility among the grain sizes contained in the feed texture, the more evident is the nonasymptotic transient trend toward equilibrium},

abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to experimentally examine the surface pressures and resulting forces on an individual sediment grain whose size is comparable to the scales of the turbulent channel flow in an effort to discern details of the flow/grain interaction. This was accomplished by measuring the pressure fluctuations on the surface of a coarse, fully exposed, spherical grain resting upon a bed of identical grains in open channel turbulent flow. This spherical particle was instrumented with low-range, high-frequency-response pressure transducers to measure the individual surface pressures simultaneously on its front, back, top and bottom. The local flow velocity was measured synchronously with a laser Doppler velocimeter. The flow and sediment are near threshold conditions for entrainment with the channel and particle Reynolds numbers varying between 31 000–39 000 and 330–440 respectively. The emphasis was on determining the characteristics of the flow field with the potential to dislodge a spherical grain under uniform flow conditions as well as in the wake of a circular cylinder placed spanwise across the flow in otherwise fully developed open channel flow. It is concluded that the streamwise velocity near the bed is most directly related to those force events (and associated individual surface pressure distributions) crucial for particle entrainment. The lift force was observed to momentarily reach values which can be consequential for particle stability, although it is poorly correlated with the fluctuating normal velocity component. Turbulence intensity near the bed, rather than being the causative factor for increased force fluctuations, was shown to be an indicator of changes in the average lift force experienced by the grain during the application of extreme drag forces, at least for this particular flow condition (the upstream, spanwise-mounted circular cylinder). This effect is known to alter the sediment transport rates significantly. The characteristics of the temporal durations of flow events about the local maxima in the stagnation pressure, drag and lift forces, using a conditional sampling method, revealed the prevalence of sweep-type near-bed flow events in generating favourable conditions for particle dislodgement, although the dominant feature is the positive streamwise velocity fluctuation, not the normal velocity component. The duration of such events was the highest in the fourth and first quadrants in the u, w plane, inducing high impulses on the grain.},

abstract = {In 1989, Sir Sam Edwards made the visionary proposition to treat jammed granular materials using a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states in analogy to thermal equilibrium statistical mechanics, despite their inherent athermal features. Since then, the statistical mechanics approach for jammed matter has garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and experimentalists. Here, we review a systematic approach to jammed matter based on the Edwards statistical mechanical ensemble. We discuss the construction of microcanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume function, which replaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems. The importance of approximation schemes at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for ensemble averaged quantities such as packing fractions and contact force distributions. An overview of the phenomenology of jammed states and experiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong assumptions underlying Edwards' approach is given including recent results suggesting the validity of Edwards ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A theoretical framework for packings whose constitutive particles range from spherical to non-spherical shapes like dimers, polymers, ellipsoids, spherocylinders or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and adhesive, monodisperse and polydisperse particles in any dimensions is discussed providing insight into an unifying phase diagram for all jammed matter. Furthermore, the connection between the Edwards' ensemble of metastable jammed states and metastability in spin-glasses is established. This highlights that the packing problem can be understood as a constraint satisfaction problem for excluded volume and force and torque balance leading to a unifying framework between the Edwards ensemble of equiprobable jammed states and out-of-equilibrium spin-glasses.},

It casts his career as that of the archetypal researcher protagonist determined to master intellectually the way water flows and conveys alluvial sediment in rivers. In that effort, Einstein personified the mix of success and frustration experienced by many researchers who have attempted to formulate the complicated behavior of alluvial rivers in terms of mechanically based equations. His formulation of the relationship between rates of bed-sediment transport (especially bedload transport) and water flow comprised an innovative departure from the largely empirical approach that prevailed at the time. He introduced into that relationship the emerging fluid-mechanic concepts of turbulence and boundary layers, and concepts of probability theory. Inevitably the numerous complexities attending sediment transport mire formulation and prompt his use of several approximating compromises in order to make estimating bed-sediment transport practicable. His formulation nonetheless is a milestone in river engineering.},

abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed the development and application of well-balanced numerical models for shallow flows in natural rivers. However, until now there have been no such models for flows with non-uniform sediment transport. This paper presents a 1D well-balanced model to simulate flows and non-capacity transport of non-uniform sediment in alluvial rivers. The active layer formulation is adopted to resolve the change of bed sediment composition. In the framework of the finite volume Slope LImiter Centred (SLIC) scheme, a surface gradient method is incorporated to attain well-balanced solutions to the governing equations. The proposed model is tested against typical cases with irregular topography, including the refilling of dredged trenches, aggradation due to sediment overloading and flood flow due to landslide dam failure. The agreement between the computed results and measured data is encouraging. Compared to a non-well-balanced model, the well-balanced model features improved performance in reproducing stage, velocity and bed deformation. It should find general applications for non-uniform sediment transport modelling in alluvial rivers, especially in mountain areas where the bed topography is mostly irregular.},

abstract = {The transport of dense particles by a turbulent flow depends on two dimensionless numbers. Depending on the ratio of the shear velocity of the flow to the settling velocity of the particles (or the Rouse number), sediment transport takes place in a thin layer localized at the surface of the sediment bed (bedload) or over the whole water depth (suspended load). Moreover, depending on the sedimentation Reynolds number, the bedload layer is embedded in the viscous sublayer or is larger. We propose here a two-phase flow model able to describe both viscous and turbulent shear flows. Particle migration is described as resulting from normal stresses, but is limited by turbulent mixing and shear-induced diffusion of particles. Using this framework, we theoretically investigate the transition between bedload and suspended load.},

abstract = {A continuous record reveals that the incidence of bedload in a coarse-grained river channel changes from flood to flood. Long periods of inactivity encourage the channel bed to consolidate sufficiently so that bedload is largely confined to the recession limb of the next flood-wave. But when flood's follow each other closely, the bed material is comparatively loose and offers less resistance to entrainment. In this case, substantial amounts of bedload are generated on the rising limb. This is confirmed by values of bed shear stress or stream power at the threshold of initial motion which can be up to five times the overall mean in the case of isolated floods or those which are the first of the season. This produces a complicated relationship between flow parameters and bedload and explains some of the difficulties in establishing bedload rating curves for coarse-grained channels. Besides this, the threshold of initial motion is shown to occur at levels of bed shear stress three times those at the thresholds offinal motion. This adds further confusion to attempts at developing predictive bedload equations and clearly indicates at least one reason why equations currently in use are unsatisfactory. Bedload is shown to be characterized by a series of pulses with a mean periodicity of 1.7 hours. In the absence of migrating bedforms, it is speculated that this well-documented pattern reflects the passage of kinematic waves of particles in a slow-moving traction carpet. The general pattern of bedload, including pulsations, is shown to occur more or less synchronously at different points across the stream channel.},

abstract = {Research examining the hydraulics, morphology, and stability of step-pool mountain streams has blossomed in the last decade, resulting in more than a dozen dissertations. These, along with other research projects, have transformed our understanding of step-pool channels. Contributions have been made toward understanding depositional step formation and destruction, scour downstream of steps, step-pool hydraulics, and the effect of sediment transport on step stability. We propose that depositional steps exist in a jammed state whereby the boulders are structurally arranged within the channel and thereby stabilize it. Once a step has formed, a scour pool with a characteristic length and depth develops downstream, creating a zone where additional steps are unlikely to occur. Downstream of the scour hole, steps are more likely to occur as the high energy associated with the plunge pool has dissipated. Data suggest that the presence of cobbles or boulders limits pool scour as well as the degree to which well-defined, channel-spanning step-pools form. We propose a state-space for step-pools in which conditions for a step to form include (1) the ratio between width and boulder diameter (the jamming ratio), (2) the ratio between applied shear stress and the stress needed to mobilize the bed (relative Shields number), and (3) the ratio between bed material supply and discharge (bed sediment concentration). Available data suggest this model is plausible. Emerging critical research questions are discussed.},

abstract = {Hans A. Einstein initiated a probabilistic approach to modelling sediment transport in rivers. His formulae were based on theory and were stimulated by laboratory investigations. The theory assumes that bed load movement occurs in individual steps of rolling, sliding or saltation and rest periods. So far very few attempts have been made to measure stochastic elements in nature. For the first time this paper presents results of radio-tracing the travel path of individual particles in a large braided gravel bed river: the Waimakariri River of New Zealand. As proposed by Einstein, it was found that rest periods can be modelled by an exponential distribution, but particle step lengths are better represented by a gamma distribution. Einstein assumed an average travel distance of 100 grain-diameters for any bed load particle between consecutive points of deposition, but larger values of 6.7 m or 150 grain-diameters and 6.1 m or 120 grain-diameters were measured for two test particle sizes. Together with other available large scale field data, a dependence of the mean step length on particle diameter relative to the D-50 Of the bed surface was found. During small floods the time used for movement represents only 2.7{\%} of the total time from erosion to deposition. The increase in percentage of time being used for transport means that it then has to be regarded in stochastic transport models. Tracing the flow path of bed load particles between erosion and deposition sites is a step towards explaining the interactions between sediment transport and river morphology.

@article{Whiting1988,
abstract = {Field observations in streams with beds of coarse sand and fine gravel have revealed that bedload moves primarily as thin, migrating accumulations of sediment, and coarse grains cluster at their leading edge. These accumulations are one or two coarse grains high and are much longer (0.2-0.6 m long in sand; 0.5-2.0 m in fine gravel) than their height. We propose the term "bedload sheet" for these features, and we argue that they result from an instability inherent to bedload movement of moderately and poorly sorted sediment. In essence, coarse particles in the bedload slow or stop each other, trap finer particles in their interstices, and thus cause the coarse particles to become mobile again. Bedload sheets develop on the stoss side of dunes, causing the dune to advance incrementally with the arrival of each sheet. Successive deposition of coarse sediment from the leading edge followed by fine sediment may generate the grain-size sorting that distinguishes cross-bedding. Available flume experiments and field observations indicate that bedload sheets are a common, but generally unrecognized, feature of heterogeneous sediment transport.},

abstract = {The entrainment of coarse sediment particles under the action of fluctuating hydrodynamic forces is investigated from an energy perspective. It is demonstrated that the entrainment of a grain resting on the channel boundary is possible when the instantaneous flow power transferred to it exceeds a critical level. Its complete removal from the bed matrix occurs only if the impinging flow events supply sufficient mechanical energy. The energy-based criterion is formulated theoretically for entrainment of individual spherical particles in both saltation and rolling modes. Out of the wide range of flow events that can perform mechanical work on a coarse grain, only those with sufficient power and duration or equivalent energy density and characteristic length scale may accomplish its complete dislodgement. The instantaneous velocity upstream of a mobile particle is synchronously recorded with its position, enabling the identification of the flow events responsible for grain entrainment by rolling at near incipient motion flow conditions. For each of the entrainment events, the energy transfer coefficient defined as the ratio of the mechanical work performed on the particle to the mean energy of the flow event responsible for its dislodgement obtains values ranging from 0.04 to 0.10. At the examined low-mobility flow conditions, the majority (about 80{\%}) of the energetic structures leading to complete particle entrainment have a characteristic length of about two to four particle diameters.},

abstract = {A fully divergence-free method is proposed for generation of inhomogeneous/anisotropic turbulence with large spatial variation. The method is based on the method of Smirnov et al., which is known to violate the divergence-free constraint when spatial variation of turbulence is present. In the proposed method a vector potential field is introduced; by taking the vector curl of the potential field one can generate a strictly divergence-free flow field. A novel formulation for scaling the vector potential field, together with a coordinate transformation strategy, is proposed in this work. The result is a six-step procedure for the generation of inhomogeneous turbulence fields. The proposed formulation is proven to reproduce the prescribed velocity correlation with energy spectrum at large Reynolds numbers. Four test cases are considered to evaluate the new method. First, the statistical quantities introduced in the proposed method are verified numerically in a classical homogeneous turbulence case. Then, the performance of the new method is demonstrated in three different inhomogeneous turbulence cases: a confined turbulent flow in a "slip-wall" box, a planar channel flow and an annular flow. It is shown that the unphysical patterns in the fluctuation fields and divergence errors produced with Smirnov?s method are absent in the results from the new method. The accuracy of the proposed methods is verified by comparing the velocity correlations with the prescribed scaling functions. The proposed method is efficient and simple to implement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Simultaneous grain motion and flow velocity measurements were made on a plane located slightly above and parallel to the sediment bed. Detailed statistical velocity information was acquired to model the velocity distribution at the bed level. This was combined with the joint probabilistic distribution of particle exposures and grain resistance to motion, which were obtained from discrete particle modeling (DPM) simulations. DPM simulations were used to provide a stochastic mathematical description of the risk that a stationary particle is entrained by the flow. Predictions from the stochastic model equations replicated the observed pulsation in sediment transport. This demonstrates that it is possible to simulate sediment entrainment and transport at a high resolution by adequately modeling all the sub-processes. A number of flow patterns were identified that caused large fluctuations of the entrainment rate. These all exhibit high velocity flow structures, but they selectively cause the dislodgement of individual particles located at different positions. This selective behavior follows from the variability of the interaction between the near-bed flow and the particles having different exposure.},

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

abstract = {We report an experimental investigation of the motion of bed load particles under steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow above a flat sediment bed of uniform grain size. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we recorded the trajectories of the moving particles and measured their velocity and the length and duration of their flights, as well as the surface density of the moving particles. Our observations show that entrained particles exhibit intermittent motion composed of the succession of periods of {\&}8220;flight{\&}8221; and periods of rest. During one flight, a particle may go through phases of reptation, during which it moves in nearly persistent contact with the rough bed, and phases of saltation, during which it travels sufficiently high above the bed to reach high velocities. The distributions of longitudinal and transverse particle velocities obey a decreasing exponential and a Gaussian law, respectively. Interestingly, these observations are similar to those previously reported for viscous flows. The experimental results presented here support the erosion-deposition model of Charru (2006) and allow the calibration of the involved coefficients. In particular, noting {\&}964;, the Shields number, and {\&}964;c, the threshold Shields number, we find that (1) the surface density of moving particles increases linearly with {\&}964; {\&}8722; {\&}964;c; (2) the average particle velocity increases linearly with {\&}964;1/2 {\&}8722; {\&}964;c1/2, with a finite nonzero value at the threshold; (3) the flight duration scales with a characteristic settling time with no significant dependence on either {\&}964; or the settling Reynolds number; and (4) the flight length increases linearly with {\&}964;1/2 {\&}8722; {\&}964;c1/2. The results presented in this paper should provide a valuable physical framework to describe bed form development in turbulent flows.},

abstract = {A 524-km reach of Fraser River, British Columbia, was traversed, where the channel alternates between gravel-bedded reaches that are incised into semiconsolidated glacial deposits and bedrock-bound reaches, including Fraser Canyon. Continuous centerline acoustic Doppler current proﬁler survey and observations of bedrock conﬁnement, supplemented with measurements on air photos, reveal the inﬂuence of bedrock on channel properties. The surveyed reach was subdivided into 10 morphological reaches, ranging from dominance by alluvial gravel-bed channels to dominantly rock-walled canyons. Measured data were grouped within each reach based on the presence of bedrock on both banks, one bank, or neither bank. From alluvial to mixed to canyon-dominated reaches, river widths decreased while water depths, ﬂow velocities, water surface slopes, and bed shear stresses increased. Within reaches, subreaches with bedrock on both banks were narrower and deeper with higher bed shear stresses but, at the observed stage, had lower depth-averaged velocity and water surface slope than partly conﬁned and alluvial (unconﬁned) subreaches. A conceptual model is presented representing a bedrock river as an alternating series of relatively low gradient, deep, rock-walled pools and steep semialluvial or alluvial sections. Downstream hydraulic geometry relations have scaling exponents expected for alluvial channels provided that the alluvial and rock-inﬂuenced sections are analyzed separately. In Fraser River, canyons become relatively narrower downstream, apparently in response to increasing rock uplift during the Quaternary period. The observations are compared against prior semitheoretical frameworks established to explain variations in width, slope, and channel shape along rockbound channels.},

abstract = {[1] Particles transported as bed load within a specified streambed area possess a distribution of velocities. This distribution figures prominently in describing the rate of sediment transport and the rate of dispersal of particles during transport. We provide a probabilistic derivation of the distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities under uniform, quasi-steady transport conditions. The formulation centers on defining the ensemble of microstates of particle momenta (the set of possible ways to partition a fixed number of particles into momentum states) subject to the constraint that the sum of the particle momenta in each microstate is fixed, a constraint that is imposed by conditions of equilibrium transport. From this, we obtain the most probable distribution of momentum states, assuming each microstate within the ensemble is equally probable. The analysis suggests that, for small particle numbers, the distribution of velocities is exponential-like but decays faster than an exponential function. For large particle numbers, the distribution is exponential. These distributions are consistent with experimental results from high-speed imaging of sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed, which reveal that the probability distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like. These particle velocity distributions also emerge from numerical analyses involving large eddy simulations of turbulent fluid motions and a discrete element method describing particle motions, wherein the large eddy simulations and discrete element method models are fully coupled in momentum.},

abstract = {Grains of a single size within a mixed-size bed are entrained over a range of flows. Within this range some grains exposed on the bed surface are active (entrained at least once over the duration of a transport event), while the remaining surface grains are immobile, a condition we define as partial transport. We demonstrate the existence and domain of partial transport using observations of grain entrainment on time series of bed photographs of flume experiments with a widely sorted sand/gravel mixture. The active proportion of the bed surface increases with bed shear stress tau(0). At a given tau(0), 90{\%} of the active grains are entrained when the cumulative mass transported exceeds approximately 4 times the active mass on the bed. Mobilization of grains in a size fraction increases from 10{\%} to 90{\%} over a range of tau(0) of a factor of 2. The bounds of this range increase with grain size D-i so that at a given tau(0), sizes over a range of a factor of 4 are in a state of partial transport. Fractional transport rates are independent of D-i for fully mobilized fractions and decrease rapidly with D-i for partially mobile fractions. partial transport is associated with substantial transport rates of finer, fully mobile sizes, limits both the rate and size distribution of grain exchange with the bed subsurface, and may be the dominant transport condition in many gravel-bed rivers.},

First, models are analysed in which storm events arise in a Poisson process, each such event being associated with a period of rainfall of random duration and constant but random intensity. Total rainfall intensity is formed by adding the contributions from all storm events. Then similar but more complex models are studied in which storms arise in a Poisson process, each storm giving rise to a cluster of rain cells and each cell being associated with a random period of rain. The main properties of these models are determined analytically. Analysis of some hourly rainfall data from Denver, Colorado shows the clustered models to be much the more satisfactory.

abstract = {This study empirically quantified the effect of sampling time on measured transport rates and fitted rating curves based on results obtained from bed load traps deployed for 2, 10, and 60 min in a coarse-bedded stream. As expected for a skewed distribution of transport rates, 2 min deployment underpredicted transport rates obtained from 10 and 60 min deployment by factors of 2 and 3 at moderate flows (50-70{\%} Q(bkf)). At near-bank-full flow the underprediction by 2 min versus 10 min sampling increased to a factor of 5, while transport rates collected during 60 min deployments were reduced because of overfilled bags. At flows near incipient gravel motion, 2 min sampling overpredicted transport rates obtained by 10 and 60 min deployment by factors of 2.7 and 3.4. The overprediction is attributed to computational effects arising mainly from the lowest measurable transport rate for each sampling time. Rating curves fitted to transport rates from 2 min sampling were significantly less steep than those for longer deployment times. However, sampling time explains only a small degree of the large difference between rating curves from bed load traps and a Helley-Smith sampler (2 min sampling).},

abstract = {The presence of sediment cover in bedrock rivers inhibits saltation-driven incision, and so accurate predictions of the relationship between bedrock exposure (Fe) and relative sediment flux (sediment supply rate over capacity sediment transport rate, Qs/Qt) are necessary to model incision and hence landscape evolution. Theoretical predictions of a linear or negative exponential form for this relationship are not consistent with laboratory data that instead demonstrate a range of different relationships. Here we use a cellular automaton (CA) model to establish how the relationship between Fe and Qs/Qt evolves from the dynamics of, and interactions between, individual sediment grains moving through a bedrock channel. The key model parameter is the probability of grain entrainment, which is altered as a function of the number of neighboring grains in order to reproduce the enhanced mobility of isolated grains on bedrock surfaces. For each model run, an equilibrium sediment cover is attained for a specified sediment input, enabling the relationship between Fe and Qs/Qt to be established. As well as both linear and exponential relationships, model runs reproduce other relationships observed in laboratory experiments. These other relationships require isolated grains to be more easily entrained than grains in sediment clusters, which is consistent with field observations of grain mobility. There is therefore a continuum of relationships between Fe and Qs/Qt; the relationship that is most applicable to a particular reach will depend on the role of channel slope, roughness and shear stress in controlling the entrainment of grains from bedrock and alluvial surfaces.},

These fluctuations may be inherent to the internal dynamics of the sediment transport process. A probabilistic framework thus seems appropriate to analyze such a process. In this paper, we present an experimental study of bedload transport over a steep slope flume for small to moderate Shields numbers. The sampling technique allows the acquisition of high‐ resolution time series of the solid discharge. The resolved time scales range from 10 −1 s up to 10 5 s. We show that two distinct time scales can be observed in the probability density function for the waiting time between moving particles. We make the point that the separation of time scales is related to collective dynamics. Proper statistics of a Markov process including collective entrainment are derived. The separation of time scales is recovered theoretically for low entrainment rates. Citation: Heyman, J., F. Mettra, H. B. Ma, and C.

@article{Montgomery1997,
abstract = {We recognize three primary channel-reach substrates: bedrock, alluvium, and colluvium. Bedrock reaches lack a contiguous alluvial bed and reflect high transport capacities relative to sediment supply; they are typically con-fined by valley walls and have steep slopes. In contrast, alluvial channels ex-hibit a wide variety of morphologies and roughness configurations that vary with slope and position within the channel network, and may be either con-fined, with little to no associated flood plain, or unconfined, with a well-established flood plain. We recognize five distinct alluvial reach morpholo-gies: cascade, step pool, plane bed, pool riffle, and dune ripple. Colluvial channels form an additional reach type that we recognize separately from alluvial channels, despite the common presence of a thin alluvial substrate. Colluvial channels typically are small headwater streams that flow over a colluvial valley fill and exhibit weak or ephemeral fluvial transport. Each of these channel types is distinguished by a distinctive channel-bed morphol-ogy, allowing rapid visual classification. Diagnostic features of each chan-nel type are summarized in Table 1 and discussed below. Cascade Channels The term " cascade " connotes tumbling flow, although its specific mor-phologic definition varies and often is applied to both channel units and reaches (e.g., Bisson et al., 1982; Grant et al., 1990). Our delineation of cas-cade channels focuses on streams in which energy dissipation is dominated by continuous tumbling and jet-and-wake flow over and around individual large clasts (e.g., Peterson and Mohanty, 1960) (Fig. 1A). Cascade channels generally occur on steep slopes, are narrowly confined by valley walls, and are characterized by longitudinally and laterally disorganized bed material typically consisting of cobbles and boulders (Fig. 2A). Small, partially channel-spanning pools spaced less than a channel width apart are common in cascade channels. Tumbling flow over individual grain steps and turbu-lence associated with jet-and-wake flow around grains dissipates much of the mechanical energy of the flow (Fig. 3A). Large particle size relative to flow depth makes the largest bed-forming material of cascade reaches effectively immobile during typical flows. Stud-ies of steep-gradient channels report that large bed-forming grains typically become mobile only during infrequent (i.e., 50–100 yr) hydrologic events (Grant et al., 1990; Kondolf et al., 1991; Whittaker, 1987b). Mobilization of these larger clasts is accompanied by high sediment transport rates due to the release of finer sediment trapped under and around large grains (Sawada et al., 1983; Warburton, 1992). During lesser floods, gravel stored in low en-ergy sites is mobilized and travels as bedload over larger bed-forming clasts (Griffiths, 1980; Schmidt and Ergenzinger, 1992). Gravel and finer material are locally stored on stoss and lee sides of flow obstructions (i.e., large grains and large woody debris) due to physical impoundment and genera-tion of velocity shadows. One tracer study (Kondolf et al., 1991) showed that material in such depositional sites was completely mobilized during a seven-year recurrence-interval event, whereas no tracer movement was ob-served during flows of less than the annual recurrence interval. These observations suggest that there are two thresholds for sediment trans-port in cascade channels. During moderate recurrence-interval flows, bedload material is rapidly and efficiently transported over the more stable bed-form-ing clasts, which have a higher mobility threshold corresponding to more in-frequent events. The lack of significant in-channel storage (Kondolf et al., 1991) and the rapid scour of depositional sites during moderately frequent high flows suggest that sediment transport is effectively supply limited in cas-cade channels. Bedload transport studies demonstrate that steep channels in mountain drainage basins are typically supply limited, receiving seasonal or stochastic sediment inputs (Nanson, 1974; Griffiths, 1980; Ashida et al., 1981; Whittaker, 1987). Because of this high transport capacity relative to sediment supply, cascade channels function primarily as sediment transport zones that rapidly deliver sediment to lower-gradient channels.},

The decline in native salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat populations has resulted from habitat loss and damage, and inadequate passage and flows caused by hydropower, agriculture, logging, and other developments; overfishing, primarily of weaker stocks in mixed-stock fisheries; and negative interactions with other fishes, including nonnative hatchery salmon and steelhead.

In between the jumps, the dynamics is not necessarily exponential. The residence times are specific for the dynamical modes and they are distributed according to general probability densities. The transitions between the modes are controlled by a matrix of transition probabilities and they generally depend on the residence times in the individual dynamical modes. Our approach is based on the explicit construction of all possible realizations of the system dynamics together with their corresponding probabilities. We give a closed formula for the averaged dynamics and we discuss the physical meaning of the probabilistic elements incorporated. The general scheme is employed in two physically relevant situations, namely, within a model of thermally activated escape including random fluctuations of the barrier height, and in the framework of the optical Bloch equations taking into account fluctuations of the resonance frequency.},

abstract = {Modern geomorphology was founded in the nineteenth century as an exercise of historical interpretation of landscapes. After the mid-twentieth century it dominantly became a quest to understand the processes by which landscapes are modified. This focused attention on the measurement of sediment fluxes on synoptic timescales and on a reductionist, Newtonian programme of construction of low-order theories about those fluxes, largely imported from engineering science. The period also saw the emergence of an applied geomor-phology. Toward the end of the twentieth century the subject was dramatically transformed by improved technologies for remote sensing and surveying of Earth's surface, the advent of personal computation and of large-scale computation, and important developments of absolute dating techniques. These technical inno-vations in turn promoted recognition of geomorphology as a 'system science' and facilitated the reintegration of tectonics into geomorphology, opening the way for a renewed consideration of the history of the land-scape. Finally, increasing recognition of the dominance of human agency in contemporary modification of Earth's terrestrial surface has become a significant theme. Important influences on the continuing develop-ment of the subject will include the search for physically sound laws for material fluxes; reconciling geomor-phological information and process representations across spatial and temporal scales, in both observation and theory; comprehending complexity in geomorphological processes and landform histories; incorporating the geomorphological role of living organisms, particularly micro-organisms; understanding the role of cli-mate in geomorphology, both in the contemporary changing climate and in the long term; and fully admitting the now dominant role of humans as geomorphic agents. Geomorphology is simultaneously developing in diverse directions: on one hand, it is becoming a more rigorous geophysical science – a significant part of a larger earth science discipline; on another, it is becoming more concerned with human social and economic values, with environmental change, conservation ethics, with the human impact on environment, and with issues of social justice and equity.

The locations of effective drag and lift forces are explored, as well as the ratio of drag and lift coefficients. The comparison between rollover and pickup probability models indicates that pickup model is valid for cases of critical shear stress less than 0.1 while rollover model works for critical shear stress larger than 0.1. Thus it is reasonable to take into consideration of both of the two models to predict sediment transport behavior in turbulent flows, especially for fluvial rivers which contain different kinds of sediment particles. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division.},

abstract = {While the stabilizing function of large grains in step-pool streams has long been recognized, the role they play in gravel-bed streams is less clear. Most researchers have ignored the role of large grains in gravel bed streams, and have assumed that the median bed surface size controls the erodibility of alluvial boundaries. The experiments presented herein challenge this convention. Two experiments were conducted that demonstrate the significant morphodynamic implications of a slight change to the coarsetail of the bed material. The two distributions had the same range of particle sizes, and nearly identical bulk d50 values (1.6 mm), however the d90 of experiment GSD1 was slightly finer (3.7 mm) than that for experiment GSD2 (3.9 mm). Transport rates during GSD1 were nearly 4 times greater than during GSD2 (even though the dimensionless shear stress was slightly lower), and the channel developed a sinuous pattern with well developed riffles, pools and bars. During GSD2 the initial channel rectangular channel remained virtually unchanged for the duration of the experiment. The relative stability of GSD2 seems to be associated with a slightly larger proportion of stable (large) grains on the bed surface: at the beginning of GSD1, 3.5{\%} of the bed was immobile, while almost twice as much of it (6.1{\%}) was immobile at the beginning of GSD2. The results demonstrate that the largest grains (not the median size) exert first order control on channel stability.},

abstract = {Depth profiles of particle streamwise velocity, concentration and bedload sediment transport rate were measured in a turbulent and supercritical water flow. One-size 6 mm diameter spherical glass beads were transported at equilibrium in a two-dimensional 10{\%} steep channel with a mobile bed. Flows were filmed from the side by a high-speed camera. Particle tracking algorithms made it possible to determine the position, velocity and trajectory of a very large number of particles. Approximately half of the sediment transport rate was composed by rolling grains, and the other half by saltation. This revealed a complex structure, with several concentration and flux peaks due to rolling, and one peak due to saltation. With an increase of the sediment transport rate, the depth structure remained the same at the water/granular interface, with peak value increases but with no shift in elevations. The saltation region expanded towards higher elevations with an increase of the particle velocity commensurate to the water velocity. The proportion of the sediment transport rate in saltation did not vary significantly. The particle streamwise velocity profiles exhibited three segments: an exponential decay in the bed, a linear increase where rolling and saltation coexisted, and above this, a logarithmic-like shape due to saltating particles. These results are comparable to profiles measured and modelled in dry granular free surface flows and in more intense bedload such as sheet flows. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Inflow discharge and outflow stage estimates for hydraulic flood models are generally derived from river gauge data. Uncertainties in the measured inflow data and the neglect of rainfall-runoff contributions to the modeled domain downstream of the gauging locations can have a significant impact on these estimated “whole reach” inflows and consequently on flood predictions. In this study, a method to incorporate rating curve uncertainty and local rainfall-runoff dynamics into the predictions of a reach-scale flood model is proposed. The methodology is applied to the July 2007 floods of the River Severn in UK. Discharge uncertainty bounds are generated applying a nonparametric local weighted regression approach to stage-discharge measurements for two gauging stations. Measured rainfall downstream from these locations is used as input to a series of subcatchment regional hydrological model to quantify additional local inflows along the main channel. A regional simplified-physics hydraulic model is then applied to combine these contributions and generate an ensemble of discharge and water elevation time series at the boundaries of a local-scale high complexity hydraulic model. Finally, the effect of these rainfall dynamics and uncertain boundary conditions are evaluated on the local-scale model. Accurate prediction of the flood peak was obtained with the proposed method, which was only possible by resolving the additional complexity of the extreme rainfall contributions over the modeled area. The findings highlight the importance of estimating boundary condition uncertainty and local rainfall contributions for accurate prediction of river flows and inundation at regional scales.},

The ability to test these formulae across numerous field sites has, until recently, been hampered by a paucity of bed load transport data for gravel bed rivers. We use 2104 bed load transport observations in 24 gravel bed rivers in Idaho to assess the performance of eight different formulations of four bed load transport equations. Results show substantial differences in performance but no consistent relationship between formula performance and degree of calibration or complexity. However, formulae containing a transport threshold typically exhibit poor performance. Furthermore, we find that the transport data are best described by a simple power function of discharge. From this we propose a new bed load transport equation and identify channel and watershed characteristics that control the exponent and coefficient of the proposed power function. We find that the exponent is principally a factor of supply-related channel armoring (transport capacity in excess of sediment supply), whereas the coefficient is related to drainage area (a surrogate for absolute sediment supply). We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed power function at 17 independent test sites},

The sediment transport rate is obtained by integrating the distribution of the ranges of the particle jumps multiplied by the average particle velocity. The relationship for the average ranges of particle jumps is an opportune combination of the Einstein and Yalin expressions. The final formulation was calibrated by means of a large number of experimental data and also by comparison with some of the most widely-used empirical formulas.

abstract = {In this work we develop a reduced-complexity model (RCM) for river delta formation (referred to as DeltaRCM in the following). It is a rule-based cellular morphodynamic model, in contrast to reductionist models based on detailed computational fluid dynamics. The basic framework of this model (DeltaRCM) consists of stochastic parcel-based cellular routing schemes for water and sediment and a set of phenomenological rules for sediment deposition and erosion. The outputs of the model include a depth-averaged flow field, water surface elevation and bed topography that evolve in time. Results show that DeltaRCM is able (1) to resolve a wide range of channel dynamics – including elongation, bifurcation, avulsion and migration – and (2) to produce a variety of deltas such as alluvial fan deltas and deltas with multiple orders of bifurcations. We also demonstrate a simple stratigraphy recording component which tracks the distribution of coarse and fine materials and the age of the deposits. Essential processes that must be included in reduced-complexity delta models include a depth-averaged flow field that guides sediment transport a nontrivial water surface profile that accounts for backwater effects at least in the main channels, both bedload and suspended sediment transport, and topographic steering of sediment transport.},

Next, the analytical and analytically numerical techniques suitable for Markov response problems such as moment equations, Petrov-Galerkin and cell-to-cell mapping techniques are briefly discussed. Usefulness of these techniques is limited by the fact that effectiveness of each of them depends on the mean rate of impulses. Another limitation is the size of the problem, i.e. the number of state variables of the dynamical system. In contrast, the applicability of the simulation techniques is not limited to Markov problems, nor is it dependent on the mean rate of impulses. Moreover their use is straightforward for a large class of point processes, at least for renewal processes.},

The focus of this study is on the stochastic aspect of the problem of incipient motion. Specifically, the role of near-bed turbulent structures and bed packing density on the commencement of sediment motion is investigated. The cornerstone of the proposed model is based on the concept that the particle motion is governed by the intermittent nature of near-bed turbulence. Based on this mechanism, in this article we provide a quantitative model for predicting the commencement of sediment entrainment for the first time under three representative bed packing densities corresponding to the isolated, wake interference, and skimming flow regimes. The performance of the proposed model is compared to published experimental data and the "conventional" approach that is based on the consideration that flow parameters are statistically well represented by a normal distribution.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A new particle-based reduced-complexity model to simulate sediment transport and channel morphology in steep streams in presented. The model CAST (Cellular Automaton Sediment Transport) contains phenomenological parameterizations, deterministic or stochastic, of sediment supply, bed load transport, and particle entrainment and deposition in a cellular-automaton space with uniform grain size. The model reproduces a realistic bed morphology and typical fluctuations in transport rates observed in steep channels. Particle hop distances, from entrainment to deposition, are well fitted by exponential distributions, in agreement with field data. The effect of stochasticity in both the entrainment and the input rate is shown. A stochastic parameterization of the entrainment is essential to create and maintain a realistic channel morphology, while the intermittent transport of grains in CAST shreds the input signal and its stochastic variability. A jamming routine has been added to CAST to simulate the grain–grain and grain–bed interactions that lead to particle jamming and step formation in a step-pool stream. The results show that jamming is effective in generating steps in unsteady conditions. Steps are created during high-flow periods and they survive during low flows only in sediment-starved conditions, in agreement with the jammed-state hypothesis of Church and Zimmermann (2007). Reduced-complexity models like CAST give new insights into the dynamics of complex phenomena such as sediment transport and bedform stability and are a useful complement to fully physically based models to test research hypotheses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We analyze the propagation of daily fluctuations in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration to soil moisture dynamics, using a stochastic model that accounts for these two different forms of hydroclimatic variability. The pulsing, intermittent behavior of daily precipitation is described by a compound Poisson process that models the unpredictability of both frequency and amount of rainfall events, while fluctuations in potential evapotranspiration that act continuously in time are assumed to be Gaussian. The resulting model for the soil water balance is thus a stochastic differential equation, forced by a state-dependent compound Poisson noise and a multiplicative Gaussian noise. Steady state probability distribution functions (pdfs) of soil moisture are obtained analytically along with the equations for the expected water balance and its variability. The multiplicative effect of temporal fluctuations in potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture reduces the soil water losses caused by evapotranspiration compared to the case when they are not present. Most importantly, the analysis also shows that because of their different forms and state dependence the impact of rainfall variability on soil moisture dynamics is much more significant than that of potential evapotranspiration, the fluctuations of which do not affect appreciably the soil moisture statistical properties.},

@article{Turowski2010,
abstract = {It has been known for a long time that sediment transport rates can vary strongly even if the ambient hydraulic conditions remain steady. In this article, a new approach is described to derive probability distributions of bed load transport rates, starting from the waiting time between the arrivals of individual sediment particles. The formalism should be valid when transport is not dominated by bed form motion. Without any assumptions about the distribution of interarrival times, the approach yields the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, a two-parameter distribution previously used in lifetime modeling. Observed dependence of mean transport rates on the sampling time and multiscaling are predicted by the distribution. Assuming exponentially and Poisson-distributed interarrival times, the same approach yields the Poisson and the gamma distributions. Using a high-resolution bed load transport data set from the Pitzbach, Austria, the distribution functions are tested on field data. The gamma distribution best describes the data, with maximum deviations of similar to 5{\%}. However, the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution may be more useful in certain applications, as it is a general approximation in the proposed formalism and no debated assumptions are necessary for its derivation.},

@article{Dietrich1984,
abstract = {Bed load transport in Muddy Creek, Wyoming, a sand-bedded meandering river with equilibrium bottom topography, was found to consist of a zone of maximum sediment flux that shifted across the channel from near the inside bank in the upstream part of the bend toward the pool at the minimum radius of curvature. Significant net cross-stream transport continued even through the crossings between the bends. The downstream bed load transport field for the bend which was studied in greatest detail was the same as that computed from bed form migration measurements and can be predicted from appropriate boundary shear stress data and the Yalin bed load equation. The zone of maximum bed load transport followed an outward-shifting region of maximum boundary shear stress, although in the downstream end of the bend the sediment transport maximum tended to stay closer to the centerline than the boundary shear stress maximum due to particle size influences. Net cross-stream transport varied with particle size and was effected by three major processes: topographically-induced, near-bed, cross-stream flow; trough wise flow along obliquely oriented bed forms; and rolling or avalanching of particles on bed form lee faces plus rolling or mass sliding on a steep cross-stream point bar side slope. Coarse particles were carried outward over the top of the point bar by a near-bed cross-stream flow that was induced by downstream shoaling. These particles then rolled and slid on the point bar side slope and eventually were carried toward the outer bank by troughwise transport along oblique dunes. In the upstream part of the bend, fine particles were carried inward by the channel curvature-induced, near-bed flow and by troughwise transport along lee faces of oblique bed forms. Fine particles and coarse particles crossed paths on top of the point bar, where weak troughwise flow moved just the finer particles toward the convex bank, and on the point bar face, where coarse particles rolled against the secondary circu- lation that was carrying the finer particles. Net cross-stream bed load transport was toward the pool and was on average about 10{\%} of the downstream bed load transport. The Engelund equation predicts reasonably well the general pattern of net cross-stream transport through the meander, but it does not account for the substantial troughwise transport caused by oblique bedforms at several locations in the bend. Our observations suggest that equilibrium bed topography occurs when there is net outward transport into the outward shifting zone of maximum boundary shear stress.},

abstract = {Random walks (RW) of particles adsorbed in the internal walls of porous deposits produced by ballistic-type growth models are studied. The particles start at the external surface of the deposits and enter their pores in order to simulate an external flux of a species towards a porous solid. For short times, the walker concentration decays as a stretched exponential of the depth z, but a crossover to long-time normal diffusion is observed in most samples. The anomalous concentration profile remains at long times in very porous solids if the walker steps are restricted to nearest neighbors and is accompanied with subdiffusion features. These findings are correlated with a decay of the explored area with z. The study of RWof tracer particles left at the internal part of the solid rules out an interpretation by diffusion equations with position-dependent coefficients. A model of RWin a tube of decreasing cross section explains those results by showing long crossovers from an effective subdiffusion regime to an asymptotic normal diffusion. The crossover position and density are analytically calculated for a tube with area decreasing exponentially with z and show good agreement with numerical data. The anomalous decay of the concentration profile is interpreted as a templating effect of the tube shape on the total number of diffusing particles at each depth, while the volumetric concentration in the actually explored porous region may not have significant decay. These results may explain the anomalous diffusion of metal atoms in porous deposits observed in recent works. They also confirm the difficulty in interpreting experimental or computational data on anomalous transport reported in recent works, particularly if only the concentration profiles are measured.

abstract = {Persistent random walks are intermediate transport processes between a uniform rectilinear motion and a Brownian motion.

The isotropic and symmetric one-dimensional persistent random walk is governed by the telegrapher's equation, also called hyperbolic heat conduction equation. These equations have been designed to resolve the paradox of the infinite speed in the heat and diffusion equations. The finiteness of both the speed and the correlation length leads to several classes of random walks: Persistent random walk in one dimension can display anomalies that cannot arise for Brownian motion such as anisotropy and asymmetries. In this work we focus on the case where the mean free path is anisotropic, the only anomaly leading to a physics that is different from the telegrapher's case. We derive exact expression of its Green's function, for its scattering statistics and distribution of first-passage time at the origin. The phenomenology of the latter shows a transition for quantities like the escape probability and the residence time.},

abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

The sediment transport rate is obtained by integrating the distribution of the ranges of the particle jumps multiplied by the average particle velocity. The relationship for the average ranges of particle jumps is an opportune combination of the Einstein and Yalin expressions.

An investigation of the hydraulic characteristics and bed-material mobility of 24 self-formed gravel-bed rivers in Colorado determined that particles as large as the median diameter of the bed surface were entrained by discharges equal to the bankfull stage or less. Particles as large as the 90th-percentile fraction were entrained by the bankfull discharge in nine of the rivers studied. Consequently, in these rivers, a significant fraction of the riverbed was entrained rather frequently over a period of years, although the transport rate was very small.},

abstract = {Double-averaged turbulence characteristics in a uniform flow over a gravel bed are studied. The log-law for the velocity is preserved above the interfacial sublayer, while the velocity within that sublayer follows a polynomial law. The Reynolds shear stress distribution within the roughness sublayer has a considerable damping. A quadrant analysis suggests that the sweeps become the prevalent mechanism within the interfacial sublayer. Within the interfacial sublayer, the quadrant plots of the form-induced velocities form a tilted pseudo-elliptical shape, suggesting that the fluid undergoes a cyclic process of upward-streamwise deceleration and downward-streamwise acceleration. An upward-downstream flux of the turbulent kinetic energy is prevalent over the entire flow depth, while a downward-upstream flux corresponding to sweep events is the mechanism within the interfacial sublayer. The energy budget indicates that the turbulent production, dissipation and diffusion, having attained their peaks, reduce sharply within the interfacial sublayer, and the pressure energy diffusion changes drastically to a negative magnitude below the virtual bed level.},

abstract = {This paper reviews sediment transport and channel morphology in small, forested streams in the Pacific Northwest region of North America to assess current knowledge of channel stability and morphology relevant to riparian management prac- tices around small streams. Small channels are defined as ones in which morphology and hydraulics may be significantly influenced by individual clasts or wood materials in the channel. Such chan- nels are headwater channels in close proximity to sediment sources, so they reflect a mix of hillslope and channel processes. Sediment inputs are derived directly from adjacent hillslopes and from the channel banks. Morphologically significant sediments move mainly as bed load, mainly at low intensity, and there is no standard method for measurement. The larger clastic and woody elements in the channel form persistent structures that trap significant vol- umes of sediment, reducing sediment transport in the short term and substantially increasing channel stability. The presence of such structures makes modeling of sediment flux in these channels – a potential substitute for measurement – difficult. Channel morphol- ogy is discussed, with some emphasis on wood related features. The problem of classifying small channels is reviewed, and it is recog- nized that useful classifications are purpose oriented. Reach scale and channel unit scale morphologies are categorized. A “distur- bance cascade” is introduced to focus attention on sediment trans- fers through the slope channel system and to identify management practices that affect sediment dynamics and consequent channel morphology. Gaps in knowledge, errors, and uncertainties have been identified for future research.},

abstract = {Experiments are described in which heavy solid grains are observed as they are propelled one at a time by a water stream over a fixed, plane, bed of grains of the same sort. This is a simplification of a sediment flow in a river, and it allows the motions of a particular grain to be followed. Three modes of movement are observed - rolling, saltating and suspension, characteristics of each mode are described, and multi-exposure photographs of grains are obtained to show the trajectories involved. In the saltation mode, grains follow low, smooth trajectories. Since no random motions are detectable on them, they appear to be governed very largely by ballistic forces; in suspension, grains follow much longer, higher paths which, being wavy, show up the influence of the irregular turbulence in the stream. The change from one mode to the other is readily observed with this technique. The grains spin in all three modes. The mean forward speed of grains U has been measured over a wide range of shear stress, shape and size of grain and of water depth. Two possible types of non-dimensional plots are presented, one of which is most appropriate to studies of the rolling mode, and the other for the suspension mode. Both methods satisfactorily correlate U with various values of the settling speed Vg in still water, for particles all of the same shape and size. There is a con- siderable difference in U for different shapes of grains, angular ones always travelling more slowly than rounded ones. Relative to the mean stream speed it, the grains travel faster at small depths than at large depths, for the same stress and Vg. The trajectories of grains confirm that the change from saltation to suspension occurs near a stage when the vertical components of turbulent velocity are approximately equal to the settling velocity of grains. Multi-exposure photographs of trajectories are analysed to deter- mine the angle of friction applicable to the process whereby the motion of grains is retarded by striking the bed. Some experiments have been done with spheres travelling over a bed consisting of cylinders in the company of many other grains. Its speed is then reduced below that which it would have as a solitary grain in the same water stream, thus indicating how the friction of the grain load reacts upon the stream to give smaller speeds close to the bed. Appendix 1 gives details of a demonstration that saltation can occur in a laminar flow, with no turbulence present at all. Appendix 2 gives the experimental data, and appendix 3 gives the algebra of the analysis of rolling motion. of the same diameter. These travel faster than any natural grains. Their dynamics, when roll- ing in contact with the cylinders, have been investigated, and a theoretical model evolved to explain the conditions under which their forward motion just stops. This model is shown to give a useful approximation to the forward speed to all types of grain just before they suddenly stop moving; these grains will not travel at all at lower speeds. Finally, an experiment is described where one marked grain is observed while moving},

abstract = {In this work we incorporate the effect of near-bed coherent flow structures into the entrainment of randomly configured mixed-size sediments. The fourth-order Gram–Charlier type probability density function (GC pdf) of near-bed streamwise velocity is employed to account for the higher-order correlations associated with turbulent bursting. A compilation of the published data over a wide range of bed roughness is used to analyze the near-bed coherent flow structures, including the second-, third-, and fourth-order moments of velocity fluctuation (i.e., turbulence intensity, skewness, and flatness factors) required in the fourth-order GC pdf. An important result of this study is a set of quantitative relations used to predict these higher-order moments as a function of the roughness Reynolds number. The random grain protrusion is parameterized with the exposure and friction heights, and an existing probabilistic approach is used to correct the hiding effect of mixed-size sediment. The above factors are all incorporated into the formulation of entrainment (rolling and lifting) probabilities. As compared to the previous normal and lognormal models, the present results demonstrate significantly improved agreement with the observed data for the unisize and mixed-size sediments under partial- and full-transport conditions. The results also reveal that the third-order GC pdf can be used to approximate the fourth-order one for the fully rough beds, however, for smooth beds the fourth-order GC pdf should be used to adequately incorporate the effects of higher-order correlations. This paper offers some new insights into the processes of sediment entrainment.},

This enables chemical master equations to be transformed into Fokker-Planck and stochastic differential equations and yields very simple descriptions of chemical equilibrium states. Certain nonequilibrium systems are investigated and the results are compared with those obtained previously. The Gaussian approximation is investigated and is found to be valid almost always, except near critical points. The stochastic differential equations derived have a few novel features, such as the possibility of pure imaginary noise terms and the possibility of higher order noise, which do not seem to have been previously studied by physicists. These features are allowable because the transform of the probability distribution is a quasiprobability, which may be negative or even complex.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify a numerical method to simulate motion of a packed or fluidized bed of fuel particles in combustion chambers, such as a grate furnace and a rotary kiln. Therefore, the various numerical methods applied in the areas of granular matter and molecular dynamics were reviewed extensively. As a result, a time driven approach was found to be suited for the numerical simulation of particle motion in combustion chambers. Furthermore., this method can also be employed to moving boundaries which are required for the present application e.g. travelling grate. The method works in a Lagrangian frame of reference, which uses the position and orientation of particles as independent variables. These are obtained by time integration of the three-dimensional dynamics equations derived from the classical Newtonian approach for each particle. This includes the keeping track of all forces and momentums acting on each particle at every time step. Viscoelastic contact forces include normal and tangential components with viscoelastic models for energy dissipation and friction. The particle shapes are approximated by spheres and ellipsoids with a varying size and ratio of the semi-axis accounting for the variety of particle geometries in a combustion chamber. For these shapes the overlap of particles during contact is expressed by a polynomial of 4th order in the two-dimensional case and a polynomial of 6th order in the three-dimensional case. A new algorithm to detect two-dimensional elliptical particle contact with sufficient accuracy was developed. It is based on a sequence of coordinate transformations and has demonstrated its reliability in numerous applications. Finally, the method was applied to simulate the motion of spherical and elliptical particles in a rectangular enclosure, on a travelling grate, and in a rotary kiln.},

These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

For instance, whereas the average number of distinct sites visited by an immortal walker grows with time without bound, that of a mortal walker may, depending on dimensionality and rate of evanescence, remain finite or keep growing with the passage of time. This number can in turn be used to calculate other classic quantities such as the survival probability of a target surrounded by diffusing traps. If the traps are immortal, the survival probability will vanish with increasing time. However, if the traps are evanescent, the target may be spared a certain death. We analytically calculate a number of basic and broadly used quantities for evanescent random walkers. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Gravel-bed river floodplains in mountain landscapes disproportionately concentrate diverse habitats, nutrient cycling, productivity of biota, and species interactions. Although stream ecologists know that river channel and floodplain habitats used by aquatic organisms are maintained by hydrologic regimes that mobilize gravel-bed sediments, terrestrial ecologists have largely been unaware of the importance of floodplain structures and processes to the life requirements of a wide variety of species. We provide insight into gravel-bed rivers as the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes. We show why gravel-bed river floodplains are the primary arena where interactions take place among aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species from microbes to grizzly bears and provide essential connectivity as corridors for movement for both aquatic and terrestrial species. Paradoxically, gravel-bed river floodplains are also disproportionately unprotected where human developments are concentrated. Structural modifications to floodplains such as roads, railways, and housing and hydrologic-altering hydroelectric or water storage dams have severe impacts to floodplain habitat diversity and productivity, restrict local and regional connectivity, and reduce the resilience of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including adaptation to climate change. To be effective, conservation efforts in glaciated mountain landscapes intended to benefit the widest variety of organisms need a paradigm shift that has gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as the central focus and that prioritizes the maintenance or restoration of the intact structure and processes of these critically important systems throughout their length and breadth.},

We show that the number of subproblems need only be logarithmic in the total number of possible labels, making this approach radically more efficient than others. We also state and prove robustness guarantees for this method in the form of regret transform bounds (in general), and also provide a more detailed analysis for the linear prediction setting.},

abstract = {Characteristics of turbulence structure in quasi-2D flows with static and weakly mobile gravel beds are presented. Three sets of measurements with acoustic Doppler velocimeters in an irrigation canal were used: two with subcritical bed shear stress (static beds) and one with the bed shear stress ?o close to critical ?oc (weakly mobile bed). The analyses included vertical distributions of local mean velocities, turbulence intensities, turbulent shear stresses, velocity auto- and cross-spectra, the quadrant method, and high-order velocity moments. A number of properties of turbulence intensities, high-order moments, streamwise bursting parameters, and velocity spectra appeared to be similar for all three flows, but some properties were different. The most important one was an observed reduction in the von Ka ´rma ´n constant for the flow with weakly mobile bed. Comparison of these results with other studies and analogies with drag-reducing flows suggest that at ?o /?oc ? 1 the drag on the bed for a given granular material should be minimized.},

This paper describes the characteristic depth of exchange achieved over a long flood series. Analysis is based on 11 recoveries of magnetically tagged gravels deployed in Carnation Creek, Canada, completed between 1990 and 2008. Vertical grain exchange mixes gravels throughout the streambed relatively rapidly. Within one to eight floods the mean burial depth approaches two times the surface layer thickness, quantified by the 90th percentile of the size distribution. Finer gravels are mixed more rapidly into the bed than coarser gravels. Both active and passive grain exchanges throughout most of the bed produce the overall vertical distribution of marked grains. Gravel exchanges exhibit fairly consistent patterns once tracers are well mixed by large floods. Results highlight the role of flood sequence in determining exchange depths, support the notion of an upper limit to exchange, and underscore the importance of passive grain exchange.},

@book{Oberlack2012,
abstract = {With the 4th ITI conference in the beautiful ancient town of Bertinoro, North Italy, 2010, the tradition of the interdisciplinary turbulence initiative (ITI) has been con- tinued. About 100 researchers from about 20 different countries gathered in the hospitable centre of the University of Bologna to present the latest contributions in turbulence research. After an external peer review process the present 63 papers were collected for this forth issue on “progress in turbulence” dedicated to the mem- ory of Prof. Tim Nickels. Shortly after giving an invited lecture at the 4th ITI con- ference, the turbulence community lost a world-class scientist, a friend and devoted family man. Basic as well as applied research is driven by the rather notorious difficult and essentially unsolved problem of turbulence. In this collection of contributions clear progress can be seen in different aspects, ranging from new quality of numerical simulations to new concepts of experimental investigations and new theoretical de- velopments. The importance of turbulence is shown for a wide range of applications including: combustion, energy, flow control, urban flows, are few examples found in this volume. A motivation this year was to bring fundamentals of turbulence in connectionwith renewable energy. This lead us to add a special topic relevant to the impact of turbulence on the wind energy conversion. Beside all progress we have to realize that a general fundamental understanding of turbulence is still missing, even though new approaches are discovered and in- vestigated. These new approaches often lead to new methods, which result in being very useful for other disciplines. Thus turbulence research has been a source of new scientific fields over the last decades. Nonlinear dynamics, chaos research, fractals and complexity may be taken as examples. This span of research from pure mathematical analysis over turbulence physics to applied turbulence research has lead in the last decades to a broad diversification of turbulence research where contact between different sub-communities has some- times been lost. Itwas in particular the latter drifting apart in the community that has been the stimulation of the interdisciplinary turbulence initiative, which started in 1999 as cooperation between physicists and engineersworking in turbulence funded by the German science foundation DFG. Based on the successful previous confer- ences, we will continue with this initiative for subsequent years with the 5th ITI Conference planned for September 2012. The structure of the present book is as such that contributions have been bun- dled according to covering topics i.e. I Basic Turbulence Aspects, II Particle Laden Flows, III Modeling and Simulations, IV, Experimental Methods, V Special Flows, VI Atmospheric Boundary Layer, VII Boundary Layer, VIII Wind Energy and IX Convection. At this point we would like to thank all authors for their contributions to this proceedings and the referees giving critical comments to the contributions and there with considerably raising the scientific quality. We would like to thank Thomas Ditzinger from Springer for his patience during the production of the book. Finally we gratefully acknowledge the staff of the University of Bologna and Olga Kelbin, George Khujadze, Andreas Rosteck for helping us to carry out this conference.},

abstract = {The inability of simulating the grain shapes of granular media accurately has been an outstanding issue preventing particle-based methods such as discrete element method from providing meaningful information for relevant scientific and engineering applications. In this study we propose a novel statistical method to generate virtual 3D particles with realistically complex yet controllable shapes and further pack them effectively for use in discrete-element modelling of granular materials. We combine the theory of random fields for spherical topology with a Fourier-shape-descriptor based method for the particle generation, and develop rigorous solutions to resolve the mathematical difficulties arising from the linking of the two. The generated particles are then packed within a prescribed container by a cell-filling algorithm based on Constrained Voronoi Tessellation. We employ two examples to demonstrate the excellent control and flexibility that the proposed method can offer in reproducing such key characteristics as shape descriptors (aspect ratio, roundness, sphericity, presence of facets, etc.), size distribution and solid fraction. The study provides a general and robust framework on effective characterization and packing of granular particles with complex shapes for discrete modelling of granular media.},

abstract = {An expert-based approach was used to identify 10 morphological unit types within a reach of the gravel bed, regulated Yuba River, California, that is heavily utilized by spawning Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Analysis of these units was carried out using two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, field-based geomorphic assessment, and detailed spawning surveying. Differently classified morphological units tended to exhibit discrete hydraulic signatures. In most cases, the Froude number adequately differentiated morphological units, but joint depth-velocity distributions proved the most effective hydraulic classification approach. Spawning activity was statistically differentiated at the mesoscale of the morphological unit. Salmon preferred lateral bar, riffle, and riffle entrance units. These units had moderately high velocity (unit median {\textgreater}0.45 m s- 1) and low depth (unit median {\textless}0.6 m), but each exhibited a unique joint depth-velocity distribution. A large proportion of redds (79{\%}) were associated with conditions of convective flow acceleration at riffle and riffle entrance locations. In addition to reflecting microhabitat requirements of fish, it was proposed that the hydraulic segregation of preferred from avoided or tolerated morphological units was linked to the mutual association of specific hydraulic conditions with suitable caliber sediment that promotes the provision and maintenance of spawning habitat. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Accounting for the burial of tracer particles during bedload transport is an important component in the formulation of tracer dispersal in rivers. Herein we propose a modified active layer formulation, which accounts for the effect of burial and admits analytical solutions, enabling insightful exploration of the phenomenon of superdiffusion of bedload tracers at the intermediate timescale. This phenomenon has been observed in recent numerical results using the 2‐D Exner‐Based Master Equation. By assuming that tracers in the active layer can exchange with nontracer particles in the substrate layer to preserve mass, and that tracers entering the substrate layer get permanently trapped during the timescale of analysis, we are able to deduce governing equations for the tracer concentration in both layers. The active layer tracer concentration is shown to be governed by an advection‐diffusion equation with a sink term, and the increase of tracers in the substrate layer is driven by a corresponding source term. The solution for the variance of tracer population is analytically determined and can be approximated by the sum of a diffusion‐induced scaling (∝t1) and an advection‐induced scaling (∝t3) terms at the intermediate timescale, which explains the phenomenon of superdiffusion. The proposed formulation is shown to be able to capture the key characteristics of tracer transport as inferred by comparison with available results of numerical simulations.},

@article{Amir2014,
abstract = {An experimental investigation into the fluctuating pressure acting on sediment particles on the bed of an open-channel flow was carried out in a large laboratory flume for a range of flow depths and bed slopes. The pressure measurements were made using 23 spherical particles instrumented with differential pressure sensors. These measurements were complemented with simultaneous measurements of the velocity field using high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The pressure statistics show that the standard deviations of the drag and lift fluctuations vary from 2.0 to 2.6 and from 2.5 to 3.4 times the wall shear stress, respectively, and are dependent on relative submergence and flow Reynolds number. The skewness is positive for the drag fluctuations and negative for the lift fluctuations. The kurtosis values of both drag and lift fluctuations increase with particle submergence. The two-particle correlation between drag and lift fluctuations is found to be relatively weak compared to the two-point drag–drag and lift–lift correlations. The pressure cross-correlations between particles separated in the longitudinal direction exhibit maxima at certain time delays corresponding to the convection velocities varying from 0.64 to 0.72 times the bulk flow velocity, being very close to the near-bed eddy convection velocities. The temporal autocorrelation of drag fluctuations decays much faster than that for the lift fluctuations; as a result, the temporal scales of lift fluctuations are 3–6 times that of drag fluctuations. The spatial and temporal scales of both drag and lift fluctuations show dependence on flow depth and bed slope. The spectral behaviour of both drag and lift fluctuations is also assessed.

abstract = {This paper reviews approaches for assessing the impacts of river regulation on stream ecosystems. These impacts can vary greatly depending on the hydro- geomorphic setting of the river, and on the change in water and sediment supply to the reach downstream. Results drawn from field studies of gravel-bed reaches of the Colorado River in Colorado and Trinity River in California illustrate the range of issues to consider in assessing the effects of flow regime and sediment transport on micro- and meso-scale habitats. Important aspects of bed-load trans- port at the local scale are discussed, along with ecological implications of spe- cific transport phases and processes. For a wide range of rivers, including those that carry predominantly fine sediment (silt and sand), the loss of channel com- plexity and habitat heterogeneity represents a broader issue. We suggest that unless the broader-scale importance of sediment input and output is recognized and quantified, restoration efforts that focus on site-specific issues or single- species enhancement are likely to fall short of their objectives.},

abstract = {Bedload transport in poorly sorted gravel bed streams is considered. Bedload and typical bed material (subpavement) size distributions are observed to be similar; it follows that the coarse half of the subpavement moves through a reach at a rate near that of the fine half. Since coarser grains are intrinsically less mobile than fine grains, it follows that some mechanism must act to nearly equalize mobility. It is hypothesized that the pavement seen in gravel bed streams at low flow is in fact in place during typical transport events capable of moving all available sizes. This pavement can provide the equalizing mechanism by exposing proportionally more coarse grains to the flow. Field data are used to quantify this concept and to develop a predictive relation for river pavement. The model indicates that pavement should be absent in most sand bed streams, in agreement with observation.},

abstract = {In gravel-bed rivers, bedload transport exhibits considerable variability in time and space. Recently, stochastic bedload transport theories have been developed to address the mechanisms and effects of bedload transport fluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle diffusivity, entrainment and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on how these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their application to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure equations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on shallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a setting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers. Experiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform flow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bedforms developed and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image processing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and its probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and entrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity and deposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment rate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied linearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability distribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian distribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast, the particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially distributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for stochastic or deterministic bedload transport models.},

There is a very nice outline here of the way different approaches to stochastic sediment transport theories have arrived at the same advection diffusion formulation (as in Parker or Ancey et al 2014). This is used to introduce an overarching problem termed 'lack of closure' to stochastic models. Closure is the relationship between the parameters required by advection diffusion forumations of sediment transport rate to measurable channel parameters. In this paper Heyman presents an experiment where particle motion was tracked from the side. Median background subtraction was employed to get particle velocity and acceleration distributions. There are a few unique contributions such as average particle velocity as a function of particle elevation. Two methods are described for calculating particle diffusivity. Analysis of particle properties seems to follow something similar to Ballio et al 2018, involving Gaussian smoothing kernels.

abstract = {The performance is tested of 12 bed load sediment transport formulae developed for use in gravel bed channels. The formulae are applied in the manner intended by the original authors. To this end, the test data are restricted to ones obtained in approximately steady flow when the material in motion was similar to that present on the bed; that is, transport was not size selective. This represents the nearest approach to “equilibrium sediment transport” that can be realized with available data. Four sets of river data and three sets of flume data were chosen for the test, covering a range of eight orders of magnitude in unit bed load transport rate. The test data were not used in the development of the formulae. The analysis separates mean bias and local bias. No formula performs consistently well. Limitations of the test data, the constraints imposed by an operationally realistic test, and reasons based upon the physics of the transport phenomenon all may be adduced for this. To estimate the magnitude of transport with limited hydraulic information, stream power equations should be used because they provide the most straightforward scale correlation of the phenomenon. In particular, the approach of Bagnold deserves further study. When local hydraulic information is available, a formula should be selected that is sensitive to bed state or grain size distribution and, in this context, the formulae of Einstein, Parker, and Ackers-White-Day bear continued examination.},

abstract = {Bedload and river morphology interact in a strong feedback manner. Bedload conditions the development of river morphology along different space and time scales; however, by concentrating the flow in preferential paths, a given morphology controls bedload for a given discharge. As bedload is a non-linear response of shear stress, local morphology is likely to have a strong impact on bedload prediction when the shear stress is averaged over the section, as is usually done. This was investigated by comparing bedloadmeasured in different bedmorphologies (step-pool, plane bed, riffle-pool, braiding, and sand beds), with bedloadmeasured in narrowflumes in the absence of any bed form, used here as a reference. The initialmethodology consisted of fitting a bedload equation to the flume data. Secondly, themorphological signature of each river was studied as the distance to this referent equation. It was concluded that each morphology affects bedload in a different way. For a given average grain shear stress, the larger the river, the larger the deviation fromthe flume transport. Narrow streams are thosemorphologies that behave more like flumes; this is particularly true with flat beds, whereas results deviate from flumes to a greater extent in step-pools. The riffle-pool's morphology impacts bedload at different levels depending on the degree of bar development, considered here through the ratio D84/D50 which is used as a proxy for the local bed patchiness and morphology. In braiding riversmorphological effects are important but difficult to assess because width is dependent on transport rate. Bedmorphologywas found to have negligible effects in sand bed rivers where the Shields stress is usually sufficiently high to minimize the non-linearity effects when hydraulics is averaged over the section.},

He ignored the degree of exposure of individual grains as a separate parameter. This report describes experiments to measure the dimensionless threshold stress and its dependence on grain protrusion, which was found to be very marked. The threshold stress for grains resting on the top of an otherwise flat bed in a turbulent stream was measured and found to be 0.01-considerably less than previously-reported values of 0.03-0.06 for beds where all grains were at the same level. It is suggested that the new lower value be used in all turbulent flow situations where the bed is of natural sediments or unlevelled material. An hypothesis is proposed that the conventional Shields diagram implicitly contains variation with protrusion between the two extremes of (i) large grains and large Reynolds numbers, with small relative protrusion, and (ii) small grains, low Reynolds numbers, and protrusion of almost a complete grain diameter. In view of this, the extent of the dip in the Shields plot is explicable in that it represents a transition between two different standards of levelling as well as the transition between laminar and turbulent flow past the grains, the range of which it overlaps considerably.},

abstract = {Estimates of sediment transport rates in gravel-bed rivers are typically developed from formulae or from a sampling campaign. The former are notoriously inaccurate; the latter require a large effort and may still not achieve acceptable accuracy. A wide range of geomorphological problems, particularly those at the watershed scale, could be addressed more accurately if reliable local estimates of transport rate could be incorporated routinely into such studies. This requires a method for estimating transport rate with acceptable accuracy and a minimum of effort. A consistent approach to estimating transport is not just a matter of which formula or sampler to use; a suitable approach requires a consistent and reliable scaling of the water discharge and an integral description of the sediment that is both meaningful and practical. An approach proposed here, using a few observations of small transport rates to calibrate a transport formula, is likely to provide a superior combination of accuracy and effort and substantially reduces flow-scaling error. Small transport rates can be measured effectively using pit samplers, which allow the sampling periods needed for accurate measurements. Grain size can be represented as two fractions, sand and gravel, which capture some of the important transport dynamics and effectively represent important environmental problems within a tractable methodological approach. The approach is nearly independent of the uncertainty associated with measuring slope and bed grain-size in the field. Copyright},

abstract = {In 1989, Sir Sam Edwards made the visionary proposition to treat jammed granular materials using a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states in analogy to thermal equilibrium statistical mechanics, despite their inherent athermal features. Since then, the statistical mechanics approach for jammed matter has garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and experimentalists. Here, we review a systematic approach to jammed matter based on the Edwards statistical mechanical ensemble. We discuss the construction of microcanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume function, which replaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems. The importance of approximation schemes at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for ensemble averaged quantities such as packing fractions and contact force distributions. An overview of the phenomenology of jammed states and experiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong assumptions underlying Edwards' approach is given including recent results suggesting the validity of Edwards ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A theoretical framework for packings whose constitutive particles range from spherical to non-spherical shapes like dimers, polymers, ellipsoids, spherocylinders or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and adhesive, monodisperse and polydisperse particles in any dimensions is discussed providing insight into an unifying phase diagram for all jammed matter. Furthermore, the connection between the Edwards' ensemble of metastable jammed states and metastability in spin-glasses is established. This highlights that the packing problem can be understood as a constraint satisfaction problem for excluded volume and force and torque balance leading to a unifying framework between the Edwards ensemble of equiprobable jammed states and out-of-equilibrium spin-glasses.},

It is found that if the bed is composed entirely of potentially mobile grains a stress-equilibrium relation at the bed surface can be defined whereby the magnitude of a certain 'bed load' of grains in transit over unit bed area is given in terms of the applied tangential stress. The bed load is independent both of the existence of any additional suspended load and of the degree of dispersion of the grains. The state of internal fluid motion enters as a single experimental constant. From a consideration of the stability of this equilibrium relation it is possible to predict the conditions under which an initially plane bed surface should become rippled; and general quantitative agreement is found with experimental data both for wind-blown and water-driven grains. Primary and secondary bed rippling are distinguished. The magnitude of the 'form-drag' due to primary bed ripples can be calculated. That due to secondary ripples is definable as an experimental constant. The gravity-free experiments disclosed that the shear resistance of a grain dispersion may vary as the square or the first power of the rate of shear, analogously to that of a true fluid, according to the value of a number G analogous to a Reynolds number. The square law is followed when the effects of grain inertia dominate over those of fluid viscosity. Assuming that the phenomenon of 'saltation' as observed over a gravity bed is an inertia effect, the conditions for saltation are predictable. The results again agree quantitatively with observation. Part II. The resistance offered by the grains to their displacement along the flow is shown to be proportional to their normal immersed weight component. And their measurable mass transport rate is hereby proportional to the rate of useful work done in transporting them. On this basis separate expressions are found for the transport rates of the bed load and suspended load, in terms of the applied tangential stress and of a tangential and a normal relative velocity respectively. When conditions are restricted to those of the 'stream case' these velocities become constant for any given system, being functions of an appropriate constant mean drag coefficient. The bed-load transport-rate expression found gives magnitudes, and variations of magnitude with grain size, in agreement with the experimental data for wind-blown sand. Agreement is also found for water-driven grains in open channels from the threshold of movement up to a certain value of the applied stress. The experimental rates are then found to increase suddenly. This increase is attributed to the development of an additional suspended load. The abrupt development of a suspended load may be explained as due to a change in the nature of the fluid turbulence when the stationary boundary becomes occluded from the fluid flow by a concentrated layer of moving bed-load grains. The assumption that under these new moving-boundary conditions the available fluid energy derived from shearing over the bed is equally apportioned between bed-load and suspended-load transport work leads to values for the suspended-load transport rate which agree closely with the experimental data. A critical relation emerges between the gravity slope of the bed, the fall velocity and the mean transport velocity of the suspended grains at which their transport may become very large. Conditions are examined under which the steady transport may be possible of grains of heterogeneous size or density. Part III. When the fluid flow is non-inertial (laminar) and the grain flow is also non-inertial the semi-empirical relations found previously for the internal stresses are such that both viscosity and shear rate can be eliminated, and a differential equation obtained whose solution gives the grain concentration in terms only of distance from the bed and of the applied tangential stress. It appears that with constant applied stress (unlimited flow depth) the degree of grain dispersion greatly exceeds that to be expected in turbulent fluid flow. But when the applied stress diminishes linearly with distance from the bed boundary a possible solution gives constant grain concentration throughout the flow. This appears to explain certain experimental results, including the behaviour of 'slurries'. The effect is examined of a fixed or partially fixed bed on the grain flow in a turbulent fluid. The effect may be pronounced in the case of suspended grains. Under certain clearly definable conditions a loose grain bed must cease to remain stationary. And if the fluid flow above is turbulent the whole grain bed should flow at constant maximum concentration, underneath the flow proper and separated from it by a moving-bed surface interface at which the concentration is discontinuous. This explains phenomena sometimes found under river torrents. The factors giving rise to and limiting the development of bed features (dunes) on a bigger scale than ripples are examined. Dune formation appears as an inherent tendency of the grain flow alone, which may or may not be inhibited by the conditions of the fluid flow.},

abstract = {A new criterion for the onset of entrainment of coarse sediment grains is presented here. It is hypothesized that not only the magnitude, but also the duration of energetic near bed turbulent events is relevant in predicting grain removal from the bed surface. It is therefore proposed that the product of force and its duration, or impulse, is a more appropriate and universal criterion for identifying conditions for particle dislodgement. This conjecture is investigated utilizing two theoretical models, representative of two modes of entrainment: saltation and rolling. In these models, instantaneous, highly fluctuating turbulent forces are simulated as short‐lived pulses of characteristic magnitude and duration, which transfer adequate fluid momentum to the particle, to trigger its entrainment. The analytical solution of the respective equations of motion is employed in deriving representations of threshold conditions in terms of the impulse characteristics. It is shown that hydrodynamic forces of sufficiently high magnitude are capable of entraining a particle only when they last long enough so that their impulse exceeds a critical value. To illustrate further the validity of the critical impulse concept, as well as extend and generalize its application to different entrainment levels of an individual grain, a novel experimental setup is utilized. This setup facilitates observations of angular displacement of a steel mobile particle in air due to electromagnetic pulses of different magnitude and duration. The experimentally obtained conditions for partial or complete entrainment support the concept of a critical impulse.},

abstract = {This Perspective summarises the properties of a variety of anomalous diffusion processes and provides the necessary tools to analyse and interpret recorded anomalous diffusion data.Modern microscopic techniques following the stochastic motion of labelled tracer particles have uncovered significant deviations from the laws of Brownian motion in a variety of animate and inanimate systems. Such anomalous diffusion can have different physical origins, which can be identified from careful data analysis. In particular, single particle tracking provides the entire trajectory of the traced particle, which allows one to evaluate different observables to quantify the dynamics of the system under observation. We here provide an extensive overview over different popular anomalous diffusion models and their properties. We pay special attention to their ergodic properties, highlighting the fact that in several of these models the long time averaged mean squared displacement shows a distinct disparity to the regular, ensemble averaged mean squared displacement. In these cases, data obtained from time averages cannot be interpreted by the standard theoretical results for the ensemble averages. Here we therefore provide a comparison of the main properties of the time averaged mean squared displacement and its statistical behaviour in terms of the scatter of the amplitudes between the time averages obtained from different trajectories. We especially demonstrate how anomalous dynamics may be identified for systems, which, on first sight, appear to be Brownian. Moreover, we discuss the ergodicity breaking parameters for the different anomalous stochastic processes and showcase the physical origins for the various behaviours. This Perspective is intended as a guidebook for both experimentalists and theorists working on systems, which exhibit anomalous diffusion.},

It must incorporate a strategy for avoiding irreversible or large-scale environmental mistakes that arise from social and political forces that tend to promote fragmented, uncritical, short-sighted, inflexible, and overly optimistic assessments of resource status, management capabilities, and the consequences of decisions and policies. Aquatic resources are vulnerable to the effects of human activities catchment-wide, and many of the landscape changes humans routinely induce cause irreversible damage (e.g., some species introductions, extinctions of ecotypes and species) or give rise to cumulative, long-term, large-scale biological and cultural consequences (e.g., accelerated erosion and sedimentation, deforestation, toxic contamination of sediments). In aquatic ecosystems, biotic impoverishment and environmental disruption caused by past management and natural events profoundly constrain the ability of future management to maintain biodiversity and restore historical ecosystem functions and values. To provide for rational, adaptive progress in ecosystem management and to reduce the risk of irreversible and unanticipated consequences, managers and scientists must identify catchments and aquatic networks where ecological integrity has been least damaged by prior management, and jointly develop means to ensure their protection as reservoirs of natural biodiversity, keystones for regional restoration, management models, monitoring benchmarks, and resources for ecological research.},

abstract = {Grains of a single size within a mixed-size bed are entrained over a range of flows. Within this range some grains exposed on the bed surface are active (entrained at least once over the duration of a transport event), while the remaining surface grains are immobile, a condition we define as partial transport. We demonstrate the existence and domain of partial transport using observations of grain entrainment on time series of bed photographs of flume experiments with a widely sorted sand/gravel mixture. The active proportion of the bed surface increases with bed shear stress tau(0). At a given tau(0), 90{\%} of the active grains are entrained when the cumulative mass transported exceeds approximately 4 times the active mass on the bed. Mobilization of grains in a size fraction increases from 10{\%} to 90{\%} over a range of tau(0) of a factor of 2. The bounds of this range increase with grain size D-i so that at a given tau(0), sizes over a range of a factor of 4 are in a state of partial transport. Fractional transport rates are independent of D-i for fully mobilized fractions and decrease rapidly with D-i for partially mobile fractions. partial transport is associated with substantial transport rates of finer, fully mobile sizes, limits both the rate and size distribution of grain exchange with the bed subsurface, and may be the dominant transport condition in many gravel-bed rivers.},

@article{Redolfi2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. American Geophysical Union. Measurement and estimation of bed load transport in gravel bed rivers are highly affected by its temporal fluctuations. Such variability is primarily driven by the flow regime but is also associated with a variety of inherent channel processes, such as flow turbulence, grain entrainment, and bed forms migration. These internal and external controls often act at comparable time scales, and are therefore difficult to disentangle, thus hindering the study of bed load variability under unsteady flow regime. In this paper, we report on laboratory experiments performed in a large, mobile bed flume where typical hydromorphological conditions of gravel bed rivers were reproduced. Data from a large number of replicated runs, including triangular and square-wave hydrographs, were used to build a statistically sound description of sediment transport processes. We found that the inherent variability of bed load flux strongly depends on the sampling interval, and it is significantly higher in complex, wandering or braided channels. This variability can be filtered out by computing the mean response over the experimental replicates, which allows us to highlight two distinctive phenomena: (i) an overshooting (undershooting) response of the mean bed load flux to a sudden increase (decrease) of discharge, and (ii) a clockwise hysteresis in the sediment rating curve. We then provide an interpretation of these findings through a conceptual mathematical model, showing how both phenomena are associated with a lagging morphological adaptation to unsteady flow. Overall, this work provides basic information for evaluating, monitoring, and managing gravel transport in morphologically active rivers.},

abstract = {In natural flows, bed sediment particles are entrained and moved by the fluctuating forces, such as lift and drag, exerted by the overlying flow on the particles. To develop a better understanding of these forces and the relation of the forces to the local flow, the downstream and vertical components of force on near-bed fixed particles and of fluid velocity above or in front of them were measured synchronously at turbulence-resolving frequencies (200 or 500 Hz) in a laboratory flume. Measurements were made for a spherical test particle fixed at various heights above a smooth bed, above a smooth bed downstream of a downstream-facing step, and in a gravel bed of similarly sized particles as well as for a cubical test particle and 7 natural particles above a smooth bed. Horizontal force was well correlated with downstream velocity and not correlated with vertical velocity or vertical momentum flux. The standard drag formula worked well to predict the horizontal force, but the required value of the drag coefficient was significantly higher than generally used to model bed load motion. For the spheres, cubes, and natural particles, average drag coefficients were found to be 0.76, 1.36, and 0.91, respectively. For comparison, the drag coefficient for a sphere settling in still water at similar particle Reynolds numbers is only about 0.4. The variability of the horizontal force relative to its mean was strongly increased by the presence of the step and the gravel bed. Peak deviations were about 30{\%} of the mean force for the sphere over the smooth bed, about twice the mean with the step, and 4 times it for the sphere protruding roughly half its diameter above the gravel bed. Vertical force correlated poorly with downstream velocity, vertical velocity, and vertical momentum flux whether measured over or ahead of the test particle. Typical formulas for shear-induced lift based on Bernoulli's principle poorly predict the vertical forces on near-bed particles. The measurements suggest that particle-scale pressure variations associated with turbulence are significant in the particle momentum balance.},

Particles as large as the 90th-percentile fraction were entrained by the bankfull discharge in nine of the rivers studied. Consequently, in these rivers, a significant fraction of the riverbed was entrained rather frequently over a period of years, although the transport rate was very small.},

abstract = {Diffusion models have been widely applied to describe fluvial long profiles. However, aggrading rivers simulated in laboratory experiments typically display much less profile curvature than a diffusion model would predict, whether aggradation is driven by subsidence or by base-level rise. Here we explore the possibility that this is due to nonclassical or non-Fickian, anomalous sediment transport in braided networks, which are known to have fractal planform geometry. We solve a fractional diffusion equation for a steady state aggrading fluvial profile for fractional exponents in the spatial derivative a in the range 1.1 {\textless}a + 1 {\textless}2. The domain is bounded at both ends, and a constant sediment sink forces extraction of all of the imposed, constant sediment supply. We assume the fractional behavior is expressed solely by a nonlocal sediment flux term. Using the right-hand Caputo fractional derivative, we are able to construct a fractional diffusion equation that admits an analytical fluvial profile closely matching the laboratory-scale physical observations. We show that this solution is also in good agreement with a Monte Carlo simulation obtained using step lengths drawn from a L{\'{e}}vy probability density. However, despite the clear nonlocal behavior, we are unable to establish a direct physical link between the power law statistics of the fluvial transport system and the mathematical ingredients in a fractional diffusion model. In general, we expect the fractional behavior to be most pronounced when the length scale of significant downstream sediment extraction is comparable to the scale range of the fractal channel pattern behavior. This is typically the case for laboratory experiments but not at field scales, which could explain why anomalously flat fluvial long profiles have not been reported from the field. Applying fractional calculus to depositional river profiles, at any scale, exposes problems in applying fractional calculus posed by the bounded domain and the presence of a distributed sink associated with sediment extraction. With present understanding, the benefit of fractional calculus, which is its ability to capture effects of power law statistics in the underlying dynamics, comes at a significant cost in terms of flexibility to handle other physical effects such as complex domains, boundary conditions, and source terms.},

The nature of induced erosion and aggradation. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 621-638.], Wolman [Wolman, M.G., 1967. A cycle of sedimentation and erosion in urban river channels. Geografiska Annaler 49A, 385-95.], Schumm [Schumm, S.A., 1969. River metamorphosis. Proceedings American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal Hydraulics Division 95, 255-73.], and Graf [Graf, W.L., 1977. The rate law in fluvial geomorphology. American Journal of Science, 277, 178-191.]. These are complemented by effects of alterations of land use, such as deforestation, intensive agriculture and incidence of fire, with the most extreme effects produced by building activity and urbanisation. Changing river channels are most evident in the channel cross-section where changes of size, shape and composition are now well-established, with up to tenfold increases or decreases illustrated by results from more than 200 world studies. In addition the overall channel planform, the network and the ecology have changed. Specific terms have become associated with changing river channels including enlargement, shrinkage and metamorphosis. Although the scope of adjustment has been established, it has not always been possible to predict what will happen in a particular location, because of complex response and contingency. The ways in which changes in cross-section relate to reach and network changes are less clear, despite investigations showing the distribution of changes along segmented channels. When considering the human role in relation to changing river channels, at least five challenges persist. First, because prediction of the nature and amount of likely change at a particular location is not certain, and because the contrasting responses of humid and arid systems needs to be considered, modelling is required to reduce uncertainty, as was first emphasised by Burkham [Burkham, D.E., 1981. Uncertainties resulting from changes in river form. American Society Civil Engineers Proceedings, Journal Hydraulics Division 107, 593-610.]. Second, feedback effects incorporated within the relationship between changes at channel, reach and network scales can have considerable implications, especially because changes now evident may have occurred, or have been initiated, under different environmental conditions. Third, consideration of global climate change is imperative when considering channel sensitivity and responses to threshold conditions. Fourth, channel design involving geomorphology should now be an integral part of restoration procedures. This requires, fifthly, greater awareness of different cultures as a basis for understanding constraints imposed by legislative frameworks. Better understanding of the ways in which the perception of the human role in changing river channels varies with culture as well as varying over time should enhance application of design for river channel landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

abstract = {Based on the mechanics of the Euler equation at short time, we show that a Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure for the vorticity field, neglecting the early stage of advection of fluid particles, allows to build a 3D incompressible velocity field that shares many properties with empirical turbulence, such as the teardrop shape of the R-Q plane. Unfortunately, non gaussianity is weak (i.e. no intermittency) and vorticity gets preferentially aligned with the wrong eigenvector of the deformation. We then show that slightly modifying the former vectorial field in order to impose the long range correlated nature of turbulence allows to reproduce the main properties of stationary flows. Doing so, we end up with a realistic incompressible, skewed and intermittent velocity field that reproduces the main characteristics of 3D turbulence in the inertial range, including correct vorticity alignment properties.},

abstract = {The problem of determining the threshold of motion of a sediment particle resting on the bed of an open channel has historically been dominated by an approach based on the time-space-averaged bed shear stress (i.e. Shields criterion). Recently, experimental studies have promoted an alternative approach to predict the dislodgement threshold, which is based on the impulse of the flow-induced force. Nonetheless, theoretical analyses accompanying these studies result in complex expressions that fail to provide a direct estimate of said impulse threshold. We employ the work-energy principle to derive a prediction of the fundamental impulse threshold that the destabilising hydrodynamic force must overcome in order to achieve full particle dislodgement. For the bed configuration studied, which is composed of spheres, the proposed expression depends on the mobile particle's size and mass, and shows excellent agreement with experimental observations previously published. The derivation presented in this paper may thus represent a robust theoretical framework that aids in the re-interpretation of existing data, as well as in the design of future experiments aimed at analysing the importance of hydrodynamic impulse as criterion for prediction of particle dislodgement.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to generate realistic packings for discrete modelling of granular materials. To generate a packing of 2D dense sample in a container of arbitrary shape, a number of key particle properties are identified as the targeted ones to reproduce, including the grain size distribution, density, particles orientations as well as specific shape characteristics of the particles. Four descriptors, including elongation, circularity, roundness, regularity, are chosen to characterize the particle shape. The considered container is discretized by a Voronoi tessellation with prescribed cell size and orientation distributions. Each Voronoi cell is then filledwith a particle with prescribed shape characteristics. Several algorithms are proposed and are compared in terms of their computational efficiency and accuracy to define the particle contours, to constrain the Voronoi tessellation and to fill the Voronoi cells with particles. Two examples are further employed to demonstrate the accuracy and the potential usefulness of the proposed method for a wide range of applications where discrete modelling of granular media is important. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

Flume experiments show that the leading front of bed-load on a 20-m-long, mixed-size gravel-bed moves anomalously, where the transient transport rate of the accelerating front varies with the observation time scale. In addition, observations show that moving particles may experience bimodal transport (i.e., coexistence of long trapping time and large jump length) related to bed coarsening and the formation of clusters on a heterogeneous gravel-bed, which is distinguished from the traditional theory of hiding-exposing interactions among mixed-size particles. A fractional derivative model is finally applied to characterize the overall behavior of partial bed-load transport, including the coexistence of the sub-diffusion and non-local feature caused by turbulence and the micro-relief within an armor layer.},

abstract = {A fundamental component of stereo vision is that of epipolar geometry. It tells us that the corresponding point of a pixel in one image is restricted to a line in another image. This constraint reduces both the complexity of finding stereo correspondences and also the chance of making incorrect matches. When a refractive surface is introduced, which is in underwater imaging, this constraint no longer holds. Instead, the corresponding point of a pixel in one image is now restricted to a curve, not a line. In this paper we investigate the impact of a planar refractive interface has on underwater imaging and stereo matching. We address the issue of 3D point projection in a refractive medium, including cases where the refractive interface is not parallel with the camera's imaging plane. A novel method for calibrating the parameters of a planar refractive interface in the local image space is proposed. We show how to compute the refractive epipolar curve for a pixel, which allows us to generate a matching cost volume that compensates for the effects of refraction. Our experimental results show that our new approach can significantly improve the results of underwater stereo matching over previous approaches.},

In an effort to frame a more inclusive paradigm for river management, we discuss sediment inputs, transport, and storage within river systems; interactions among water, sediment, and valley context; and the need to broaden the natural flow regime concept. Explicitly incorporating sediment is challenging, because sediment is supplied, transported, and stored by nonlinear and episodic processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales than water and because sediment regimes have been highly altered by humans. Nevertheless, managing for a desired balance between sediment supply and transport capacity is not only tractable, given current geomorphic process knowledge, but also essential because of the importance of sediment regimes to aquatic and riparian ecosystems, the physical template of which depends on sediment-driven river structure and function.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional simulation model of travel distances of individual particles in a gravel-bed river is presented. The model is based on a number of rules, which include particle size, entrainment, trajectory, distance of movement and entrapment. Particle interactions are controlled by resistance fields defined about each obstacle and critical elevation defined in the model. Resistance fields, particle dropping and critical elevation rules control particle interactions. The interaction rules cause the particles to develop pebble clusters, stone cells and transverse structures (transverse ribs). The simulated travel distances of individual particles are consistent with reported field results. Individual particle travel distances were simulated using two different models; one without interactions between the individual particles and the stationary bed and one with interactions. The case without interactions demonstrates the random nature of sediment transport, and narrow ranges of travel distances. Wider ranges of travel distances, similar to those for natural situations, were obtained for the cases with interactions. The more intense the interaction between the mobile stones and the stationary ones, the wider the range of distances of travel for a given particle size. Modelling the mean travel distance yielded a result similar to that published previously, which was based on empirical data. Well developed bed-surface structures were obtained for relatively poorly sorted sediment with intense interactions between particles. Transverse structures developed when relatively large particles were allowed to move.},

abstract = {A high-speed video system was used to study the interaction between sediment particles and turbulence in the wall region of an open channel flow with both smooth and transitionally rough beds. In smooth flows, particles immersed within the viscous sublayer were seen to accumulate along low-speed wall streaks; apparently due to the presence of quasi-streamwise vortices in the wall region. Larger particles did not tend to group along streaks, however their velocity was observed to respond to the streaky structure of the flow velocity in the wall region. In transitionally rough flows particle sorting was not observed. Coherent flow structures in the form of shear layers typically observed in the near-wall region interacted with sediment particles lying on the channel bottom, resulting in the particles being entrained into suspension. Although there has been some speculation that this process would not be effective in entraining particles totally immersed in the viscous sublayer, the results obtained demonstrate the opposite. The entrainment mechanism appears to be the same independent of the roughness condition of the bottom wall, smooth or transitionally rough. In the latter case, however, hiding effects tend to preclude the entrainment of particles with sizes finer than that of the roughness elements. The analysis of particle velocity during entrainment shows that the streamwise component tends to be much smaller than the local mean flow velocity, while the vertical component tends to be much larger than the local standard deviation of the vertical flow velocity fluctuations, which would indicate that such particles are responding to rather extreme flow ejection events.},

abstract = {The beds of gravel-bed rivers commonly display distinct sorting patterns, which at length scales of {\~{}}. 0.1. 1 channel widths appear to form an organization of patches or facies. This paper explores alternatives to traditional visual facies mapping by investigating methods of patch delineation in which clustering analysis is applied to a high-resolution grid of spatial grain-size distributions (GSDs) collected during a flume experiment. Specifically, we examine four clustering techniques: 1) partitional clustering of grain-size distributions with the k-means algorithm (assigning each GSD to a type of patch based solely on its distribution characteristics), 2) spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering ("growing" patches by merging adjacent GSDs, thus generating a hierarchical structure of patchiness), 3) spectral clustering using Normalized Cuts (using the spatial distance between GSDs and the distribution characteristics to generate a matrix describing the similarity between all GSDs, and using the eigenvalues of this matrix to divide the bed into patches), and 4) fuzzy clustering with the fuzzy c-means algorithm (assigning each GSD a membership probability to every patch type). For each clustering method, we calculate metrics describing how well-separated cluster-average GSDs are and how patches are arranged in space. We use these metrics to compute optimal clustering parameters, to compare the clustering methods against each other, and to compare clustering results with patches mapped visually during the flume experiment.All clustering methods produced better-separated patch GSDs than the visually-delineated patches. Although they do not produce crisp cluster assignment, fuzzy algorithms provide useful information that can characterize the uncertainty of a location on the bed belonging to any particular type of patch, and they can be used to characterize zones of transition from one patch to another. The extent to which spatial information influences clustering leads to a trade-off between the quality of GSD separation between patch types and the spatial coherence of patches. Methods incorporating spatial information during the clustering process tended to produce a finite number of types of patches. As methods improve for collecting high-resolution grain size data, the approaches described here can be scaled up to field studies to better characterize the grain size heterogeneity of river beds. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {As the result of current and historical metal mining, river channels and floodplains in many parts of the world have become contaminated by metal-rich waste in concentrations that may pose a hazard to human livelihoods and sustainable development. Environmental and human health impacts commonly arise because of the prolonged residence time of heavy metals in river sediments and alluvial soils and their bioaccumulatory nature in plants and animals. This paper considers how an understanding of the processes of sediment-associated metal dispersion in rivers, and the space and timescales over which they operate, can be used in a practical way to help river basin managers more effectively control and remediate catchments affected by current and historical metal mining. A geomorphological approach to the management of rivers contaminated by metals is outlined and four emerging research themes are highlighted and critically reviewed. These are: (1) response and recovery of river systems following the failures of major tailings dams; (2) effects of flooding on river contamination and the sustainable use of floodplains; (3) new developments in isotopic fingerprinting, remote sensing and numerical modelling for identifying the sources of contaminant metals and for mapping the spatial distribution of contaminants in river channels and floodplains; and (4) current approaches to the remediation of river basins affected by mining, appraised in light of the European Union's Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Future opportunities for geomorphologically-based assessments of mining-affected catchments are also identified. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a new random walk model for bed load sediment transport that explains the scale-dependency generally observed in transport rates and captures the transient anomalous dispersion often seen in rivers. Particles alternate between mobile and resting phases, with a tempered stable probability distribution for both particle step length and resting time. Tempered fractional mobile-immobile differential equations model the ensemble average of particle dynamics. The model is tested against data from three sediment dispersion experiments. Using tempering in both space and time, the new model is able to capture the full range of observed ensemble particle dynamics. The random walk model illuminates the physical meaning of all transport parameters in the mobile-immobile equations and explains transitions between observed super-diffusive, sub-diffusive, and regular diffusive ensemble particle dynamics. By explicitly predicting the effects of spatial and temporal averaging on particle dynamics, this method can be used to link observations of fluvial sediment dynamics across scales. This approach is also generally applicable to a wide variety of geophysical and ecological dynamics, such as ecological dispersal, pathogen transmission in rivers, nutrient export from watersheds, and large-scale geomorphodynamics associated with infrequent phenomena such as avalanches and turbidity currents.},

abstract = {ed load transport is a highly stochastic, multiscale process, where particle advection and diffusion regimes are governed by the dynamics of each sediment grain during its motion and resting states. Having a quantitative understanding of the macroscale behavior emerging from the microscale interactions is important for proper model selection in the absence of individual grain‐scale observations. Here we develop a semimechanistic sediment transport model based on individual particle dynamics, which incorporates the episodic movement (steps separated by rests) of sediment particles and study their macroscale behavior. By incorporating different types of probability distribution functions (PDFs) of particle resting times urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr21990:wrcr21990-math-0001, under the assumption of thin‐tailed PDF of particle velocities, we study the emergent behavior of particle advection and diffusion regimes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. For exponential PDFs of resting times urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr21990:wrcr21990-math-0002, we observe normal advection and diffusion at long time scales. For a power‐law PDF of resting times (i.e., urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr21990:wrcr21990-math-0003), the tail thickness parameter urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr21990:wrcr21990-math-0004 is observed to affect the advection regimes (both sub and normal advective), and the diffusion regimes (both subdiffusive and superdiffusive). By comparing our semimechanistic model with two random walk models in the literature, we further suggest that in order to reproduce accurately the emerging diffusive regimes, the resting time model has to be coupled with a particle motion model able to produce finite particle velocities during steps, as the episodic model discussed here.},

Extending to arbitrary wave number a previous long wave analysis [$\backslash$nF. Charru and E. J. Hinch, J. Fluid Mech. 550, 111 (2006)$\backslash$n], this study shows that short waves are stabilized by a crest-erosion mechanism that is absent when the local particle flux is assumed to be in equilibrium with the local bed shear stress. The cutoff length associated with this mechanism scales on a deposition length of the particles. This characteristic length is similar, although of a different physical nature, to the inertial length involved in relaxation models of dune dynamics under the wind. Two stabilizing mechanisms cooperate for the most amplified wave number: the new crest-erosion mechanism and the gravity force parallel to the local slope of the inclined bed. The predictions of this model are compared to observations, showing better agreement than previous stability analyses, which strongly underpredict the observed lengths.},

The cornerstone of the proposed model is based on the concept that the particle motion is governed by the intermittent nature of near-bed turbulence. Based on this mechanism, in this article we provide a quantitative model for predicting the commencement of sediment entrainment for the first time under three representative bed packing densities corresponding to the isolated, wake interference, and skimming flow regimes.

Experiments on entrainment, transport, and deposition of tracer stones in a flume described here were designed to address this issue. Predictors of statistics of bed elevation fluctuations at short timescales, total and elevation-specific particle entrainment rates, particle step lengths, mean and associated probability density function for particle virtual velocity, and thickness of the active layer were developed. The working hypothesis tested in this paper is that the statistics of tracer displacements can be related to channel-averaged hydraulic parameters, and thus linked to macroscopic aspects of bed load transport.},

Morphological style is determined chiefly by the caliber and quantity of sediment delivered to the channel, although modulated by channel scale.

In this review, the problem is studied by defining sediment transport regimes on the basis of the Shields number, a nondimensional measure of the capacity of the channel to move sediment of a given caliber. The problem is also approached from an inverse perspective by which the quantity and character of sediment deposits are used to infer details about the vari-ation of sediment transport and sedimentation along a channel.

abstract = {Predicting shallow landslide size and location across landscapes is important for understanding landscape form and evolution and for hazard identification. We test a recently developed model that couples a search algorithm with 3-D slope stability analysis that predicts these two key attributes in an intensively studied landscape with a 10 year landslide inventory. We use process-based submodels to estimate soil depth, root strength, and pore pressure for a sequence of landslide-triggering rainstorms. We parameterize submodels with field measurements independently of the slope stability model, without calibrating predictions to observations. The model generally reproduces observed landslide size and location distributions, overlaps 65{\%} of observed landslides, and of these predicts size to within factors of 2 and 1.5 in 55{\%} and 28{\%} of cases, respectively. Five percent of the landscape is predicted unstable, compared to 2{\%} recorded landslide area. Missed landslides are not due to the search algorithm but to the formulation and parameterization of the slope stability model and inaccuracy of observed landslide maps. Our model does not improve location prediction relative to infinite-slope methods but predicts landslide size, improves process representation, and reduces reliance on effective parameters. Increasing rainfall intensity or root cohesion generally increases landslide size and shifts locations down hollow axes, while increasing cohesion restricts unstable locations to areas with deepest soils. Our findings suggest that shallow landslide abundance, location, and size are ultimately controlled by covarying topographic, material, and hydrologic properties. Estimating the spatiotemporal patterns of root strength, pore pressure, and soil depth across a landscapemay be the greatest remaining challenge.},

abstract = {The illumination of single population behaviour subject to the processes of birth, death and immigration has provided a basis for the discussion of the non-Gaussian statistical and temporal correlation properties of scattered radiation. As a first step towards the modelling of its spatial correlations, we consider the populations supported by an infinite chain of discrete sites, each subject to birth, death and immigration and coupled by migration between adjacent sites. To provide some motivation, and illustrate the techniques we will use, the migration process for a single particle on an infinite chain of sites is introduced and its diffusion dynamics derived. A certain continuum limit is identified and its properties studied via asymptotic analysis. This forms the basis of the multi-particle model of a coupled population subject to single site birth, death and immigration processes, in addition to inter-site migration. A discrete rate equation is formulated and its generating function dynamics derived. This facilitates derivation of the equations of motion for the first- and second-order cumulants, thus generalizing the earlier results of Bailey through the incorporation of immigration at each site. We present a novel matrix formalism operating in the time domain that enables solution of these equations yielding the mean occupancy and inter-site variances in the closed form. The results for the first two moments at a single time are used to derive expressions for the asymptotic time-delayed correlation functions, which relates to Glauber's analysis of an Ising model. The paper concludes with an analysis of the continuum limit of the birth–death–immigration–migration process in terms of a path integral formalism. The continuum rate equation and evolution equation for the generating function are developed, from which the evolution equation of the mean occupancy is derived, in this limit. Its solution is provided in closed form.},

abstract = {1 The relation between equilibrium stream channel morphology and three independent governing variables, discharge, sediment supply, and valley slope, is investigated using a stream table. The experiments are based on a generic physical model of a laterally active gravel bed stream and directed by a recently published rational regime model. While a variety of channel adjustments are possible, the primary adjustment observed was in the channel slope. Other adjustments, such as surface armor composition and cross-sectional shape, were minor in comparison. The equilibrium slope is well predicted by a linear function of sediment concentration which is bounded by two thresholds: one associated with the minimum stream power necessary to deform the bed and the other associated with the maximum sediment feed that can be transported by the available flow. The results suggest that the system tends to move toward the minimum slope capable of transporting the sediment supply, in the process increasing the flow resistance for the system. Whether or not a minimum slope or a maximum system-scale flow resistance is reached cannot be determined given the available data, but there appears to be a unique slope or, at least, a limited range of slopes) for which a stable alluvial channel morphology can be established for a given sediment concentration. The implications of this behavior are evaluated for the theoretical basis of the extremal hypothesis used to close the formulation of a rational regime model.},

abstract = {Anomalous transport in porous media is commonly believed to be induced by the highly complex pore space geometry. However, this phenomenon is also observed in porous media with rather simple pore structure. In order to answer how ubiquitous can anomalous transport be in porous media, we in this work systematically investigate the solute transport process in a simple porous medium model with minimal structural randomness. The porosities we consider range widely from 0.30 up to 0.85, and we find by lattice Boltzmann simulations that the solute transport process can be anomalous in all cases at high p{\'{e}}clet numbers. We use the continuous time random walk theory to quantitatively explain the observed scaling relations of the process. A plausible hydrodynamic origin of anomalous transport in simple porous media is proposed as a complement to its widely accepted geometric origin in complex porous media. Our results, together with previous findings, provide evidence that anomalous transport is indeed ubiquitous in porous media. Consequently, attentions should be paid when modelling solute transport by the classical advection-diffusion equation, which could lead to systematic error. Anomalous (or non-Fickian) transport has been recognized as a common phenomenon in porous media whose complex pore space geometry strongly influences the flow and transport processes therein 1,2. Many field and laboratory experiments, as well as pore-scale numerical simulations 3-19 , have confirmed the existence of a non-Gaussian solute concentration profile and an asymptotically nonlinear dependence of the concentration spatial variance (M 2 as defined below) on time t (i.e., $\beta$ {\~{}} M t 2 with $\beta$ ≠ 1). These two typical features of anomalous transport are in great contrast with the prediction of the classical advection-diffusion equation (ADE). Various approaches have been proposed to model the anomalous transport process by taking into account a widely distributed heterogeneous velocity field 2,20-37. It is perhaps natural to ascribe the heterogeneity of the velocity field, and the resultant anomalous transport, to the complex geometry of pore space, and it is indeed so in some cases. For example, anomalous transport can emerge due to the non-trivial complex structure (scale-free connection patterns) of the underlying network in which the transport process takes place 20. Also, experimental as well as numerical evidence has shown that the type of the transport process can undergo qualitative changes as the pore space structure becomes more complex 9. However, on the other hand, we also notice there has been experimental and numerical evidence that even for some structurally "simple" porous media, the solute transport process can be anomalous at high P{\'{e}}clet numbers 4,14,38,39. In such cases, the porous media are regular or very weakly complex in void space geometry; there can hardly be any non-trivial spatial structure that is complex enough to induce a highly heterogeneous velocity field. Hence, the structural complexity does not seem to be the major source of the anomaly. Concerning these facts, one may wonder how much geometric complexity is needed to induce anomalous transport, and whether anomalous transport can be persistently observed in porous media with simple pore space structure.},

abstract = {Physical models of gravel braided rivers were used to investigate the adjustment of braiding intensity to step changes in channel-forming discharge and the mechanisms by which channel pattern adjustment and maintenance occurs. A braided channel developed at low discharge was subjected to two step increases in discharge between which the channel was given time to develop stable average braiding intensity in response to each steady discharge. Active (with visible bed material movement) and total channel networks were mapped throughout the experiment. Total braiding intensity exceeded active braiding intensity and both adjusted to a stable, average value at each discharge, indicating that channel pattern adjustment to total discharge involves both the active and the total network. Only portions of the total braided channel network developed at a given time, and it formed progressively by migration and avulsion of the (less extensive) active network. At equilibrium, the ratio of active to total braiding intensity stabilized at about 0.4. This stable value may increase with relative mobility of the bed material (stream power relative to grain size). The stable value was achieved via gradual increase of total braiding intensity while active braiding intensity adjusted very quickly to the increased flow. These adjustments are controlled by partial avulsion of the main active channel associated with changes in its sinuosity, and allocation of flow and bed load to secondary anabranches. Braided channel pattern dynamics is closely tied to, and explained by, the local dynamics and symmetry/asymmetry of bifurcations and avulsions.},

abstract = {Bedload and river morphology interact in a strong feedback manner. Bedload conditions the development of river morphology along different space and time scales; however, by concentrating the flow in preferential paths, a given morphology controls bedload for a given discharge. As bedload is a non-linear response of shear stress, local morphology is likely to have a strong impact on bedload prediction when the shear stress is averaged over the section, as is usually done. This was investigated by comparing bedloadmeasured in different bedmorphologies (step-pool, plane bed, riffle-pool, braiding, and sand beds), with bedloadmeasured in narrowflumes in the absence of any bed form, used here as a reference. The initialmethodology consisted of fitting a bedload equation to the flume data. Secondly, themorphological signature of each river was studied as the distance to this referent equation. It was concluded that each morphology affects bedload in a different way. For a given average grain shear stress, the larger the river, the larger the deviation fromthe flume transport. Narrow streams are thosemorphologies that behave more like flumes; this is particularly true with flat beds, whereas results deviate from flumes to a greater extent in step-pools. The riffle-pool's morphology impacts bedload at different levels depending on the degree of bar development, considered here through the ratio D84/D50 which is used as a proxy for the local bed patchiness and morphology. In braiding riversmorphological effects are important but difficult to assess because width is dependent on transport rate. Bedmorphologywas found to have negligible effects in sand bed rivers where the Shields stress is usually sufficiently high to minimize the non-linearity effects when hydraulics is averaged over the section.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a generalized Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) (gLoG) filter for detecting general elliptical blob structures in images. The gLoG filter can not only accurately locate the blob centers but also estimate the scales, shapes, and orientations of the detected blobs. These functions can be realized by generalizing the common 3-D LoG scale-space blob detector to a 5-D gLoG scale-space one, where the five parameters are image-domain coordinates (x, y), scales ({\$}\sigma{\$}(x), {\$}\sigma{\$}(y)), and orientation ({\$}\theta{\$}), respectively. Instead of searching the local extrema of the image's 5-D gLoG scale space for locating blobs, a more feasible solution is given by locating the local maxima of an intermediate map, which is obtained by aggregating the log-scale-normalized convolution responses of each individual gLoG filter. The proposed gLoG-based blob detector is applied to both biomedical images and natural ones such as general road-scene images. For the biomedical applications on pathological and fluorescent microscopic images, the gLoG blob detector can accurately detect the centers and estimate the sizes and orientations of cell nuclei. These centers are utilized as markers for a watershed-based touching-cell splitting method to split touching nuclei and counting cells in segmentation-free images. For the application on road images, the proposed detector can produce promising estimation of texture orientations, achieving an accurate texture-based road vanishing point detection method. The implementation of our method is quite straightforward due to a very small number of tunable parameters.},

The proposed model incorporates an exchange process between the bed load and the suspended load layer, in addition to the interface between the bed-load layer and the bed material, as normally considered in most of the existing sediment transport studies. In this study the mathematical treatment of the continuous-time Markov chain is clarified to stress the difference in definitions of the continuous-time and discrete-time Markov chains. With the employment of the continuous-time Markov model, the bed-load transport capacity in the long run and the time-varying transport rates can be derived. On the other hand, the three-state model can assist in distinguishing whether the flow is subject to significant suspended load or not. Furthermore, the distribution of particles in each of the three layers can be quantified. The proposed model is validated against natural river data. The comparison has shown a reasonably good agreement and thus the validity of the proposed model is confirmed.},

The effects of sediment transport and bed change on the flow are considered in the flow continuity and momentum equations. An explicit algorithm is adopted to solve the governing equations. The model has been tested preliminarily in several experimental cases, including an experiment on wedge development due to sediment overloading under transcritical flow conditions, an experiment on dam surface erosion due to overtopping flow, and two experiments on dam-break flow over movable beds. The model performs quite well in the cases of wedge development and overtopping flow, but significantly under-predicts the bed erosion due to dam-break flow. A modification has thus been made by considering the effects of sediment concentration on sediment settling and entrainment in the case of dam-break flow over movable beds. The present model has been compared with the traditional movable-bed “clear-water” model that ignores the effects of sediment on the flow. It has been found that the present model provides more reasonable predictions, and the “clear-water” model has larger errors when sediment transport is stronger and may even fail in the case of dam-break flow.},

abstract = {This study addresses the rotting and lifting probabilities for sediment entrainment by incorporating the probabilistic features of the turbulent fluctuation and bed grain geometry. The lognormally distributed instantaneous velocity and uniformly distributed initial grain position, along with a relation between lift coefficient and particle Reynolds number, are used to extend the theoretical formulation of the entrainment probabilities in smooth-bed flows. The two threshold conditions identified herein enable us to precisely define the probabilities of entrainment in the rolling and lifting modes. The results obtained in this study coincide well with the published data. The lifting probability increases monotonously with the dimensionless shear stress theta, which is consistent with the earlier results yet displays improved agreement with the experimental data. The maximum value of rolling probability, with a magnitude of 0.25, occurs at theta approximate to0.15. For theta{\textless}0.05 (or {\&}theta;{\textgreater}0.6), the rotting (or lifting) probability makes up more than 90{\%} of the total entrainment probability and thus can be used as an approximation to the total probability of entrainment. The proposed rolling and lifting probabilities are further linked to the two separate criteria for incipient motion to explore the critical entrainment probabilities. The results reveal that a consistent probability corresponding to the critical state of sediment entrainment cannot be found.},

abstract = {Experiments are described in which heavy solid grains are observed as they are propelled one at a time by a water stream over a fixed, plane, bed of grains of the same sort. This is a simplification of a sediment flow in a river, and it allows the motions of a particular grain to be followed. Three modes of movement are observed - rolling, saltating and suspension, characteristics of each mode are described, and multi-exposure photographs of grains are obtained to show the trajectories involved. In the saltation mode, grains follow low, smooth trajectories. Since no random motions are detectable on them, they appear to be governed very largely by ballistic forces; in suspension, grains follow much longer, higher paths which, being wavy, show up the influence of the irregular turbulence in the stream. The change from one mode to the other is readily observed with this technique. The grains spin in all three modes. The mean forward speed of grains U has been measured over a wide range of shear stress, shape and size of grain and of water depth. Two possible types of non-dimensional plots are presented, one of which is most appropriate to studies of the rolling mode, and the other for the suspension mode. Both methods satisfactorily correlate U with various values of the settling speed Vg in still water, for particles all of the same shape and size. There is a con- siderable difference in U for different shapes of grains, angular ones always travelling more slowly than rounded ones. Relative to the mean stream speed it, the grains travel faster at small depths than at large depths, for the same stress and Vg. The trajectories of grains confirm that the change from saltation to suspension occurs near a stage when the vertical components of turbulent velocity are approximately equal to the settling velocity of grains. Multi-exposure photographs of trajectories are analysed to deter- mine the angle of friction applicable to the process whereby the motion of grains is retarded by striking the bed. Some experiments have been done with spheres travelling over a bed consisting of cylinders in the company of many other grains. Its speed is then reduced below that which it would have as a solitary grain in the same water stream, thus indicating how the friction of the grain load reacts upon the stream to give smaller speeds close to the bed. Appendix 1 gives details of a demonstration that saltation can occur in a laminar flow, with no turbulence present at all. Appendix 2 gives the experimental data, and appendix 3 gives the algebra of the analysis of rolling motion. of the same diameter. These travel faster than any natural grains. Their dynamics, when roll- ing in contact with the cylinders, have been investigated, and a theoretical model evolved to explain the conditions under which their forward motion just stops. This model is shown to give a useful approximation to the forward speed to all types of grain just before they suddenly stop moving; these grains will not travel at all at lower speeds. Finally, an experiment is described where one marked grain is observed while moving},

abstract = {This paper concerns a model of bed load transport, which describes the advection and dispersion of coarse particles carried by a turbulent water stream. The challenge is to develop a microstructural approach that, on the one hand, yields a parsimonious description of particle transport at the microscopic scale and, on the other hand, leads to averaged equations at the macroscopic scale that can be consistently interpreted in light of the continuum equations used in hydraulics. The cornerstone of the theory is the proper determination of the particle flux fluctuations. Apart from turbulence-induced noise, fluctuations in the particle transport rate are generated by particle exchanges with the bed consisting of particle entrainment and deposition. At the particle scale, the evolution of the number of moving particles can be described probabilistically using a coupled set of reaction–diffusion master equations. Theoretically, this is interesting but impractical, as solving the governing equations is fraught with difficulty. Using the Poisson representation, we show that these multivariate master equations can be converted into Fokker–Planck equations without any simplifying approximations. Thus, in the continuum limit, we end up with a Langevin-like stochastic partial differential equation that governs the time and space variations of the probability density function for the number of moving particles. For steady-state flow conditions and a fixed control volume, the probability distributions of the number of moving particles and the particle flux can be calculated analytically. Taking the average of the microscopic governing equations leads to an average mass conservation equation, which takes the form of the classic Exner equation under certain conditions carefully addressed in the paper. Analysis also highlights the specific part played by a process we refer to as collective entrainment, i.e. a nonlinear feedback process in particle entrainment. In the absence of collective entrainment the fluctuations in the number of moving particles are Poissonian, which implies that at the macroscopic scale they act as white noise that mediates bed evolution. In contrast, when collective entrainment occurs, large non-Poissonian fluctuations arise, with the important consequence that the evolution at the macroscopic scale may depart significantly that predicted by the averaged Exner equation. Comparison with experimental data gives satisfactory results for steady-state flows.},

@article{Bagnold1956,
abstract = {Part I. The results of previous experiments (Bagnold 1954) on the stresses set up in a uniform gravity-free dispersion of solid grains when uniformly sheared in a fluid are applied to the non-uniform case of grain flow over a gravity bed, assuming the results are quantitatively applicable to any sufficiently thin shear layer. It is found that if the bed is composed entirely of potentially mobile grains a stress-equilibrium relation at the bed surface can be defined whereby the magnitude of a certain 'bed load' of grains in transit over unit bed area is given in terms of the applied tangential stress. The bed load is independent both of the existence of any additional suspended load and of the degree of dispersion of the grains. The state of internal fluid motion enters as a single experimental constant. From a consideration of the stability of this equilibrium relation it is possible to predict the conditions under which an initially plane bed surface should become rippled; and general quantitative agreement is found with experimental data both for wind-blown and water-driven grains. Primary and secondary bed rippling are distinguished. The magnitude of the 'form-drag' due to primary bed ripples can be calculated. That due to secondary ripples is definable as an experimental constant. The gravity-free experiments disclosed that the shear resistance of a grain dispersion may vary as the square or the first power of the rate of shear, analogously to that of a true fluid, according to the value of a number G analogous to a Reynolds number. The square law is followed when the effects of grain inertia dominate over those of fluid viscosity. Assuming that the phenomenon of 'saltation' as observed over a gravity bed is an inertia effect, the conditions for saltation are predictable. The results again agree quantitatively with observation. Part II. The resistance offered by the grains to their displacement along the flow is shown to be proportional to their normal immersed weight component. And their measurable mass transport rate is hereby proportional to the rate of useful work done in transporting them. On this basis separate expressions are found for the transport rates of the bed load and suspended load, in terms of the applied tangential stress and of a tangential and a normal relative velocity respectively. When conditions are restricted to those of the 'stream case' these velocities become constant for any given system, being functions of an appropriate constant mean drag coefficient. The bed-load transport-rate expression found gives magnitudes, and variations of magnitude with grain size, in agreement with the experimental data for wind-blown sand. Agreement is also found for water-driven grains in open channels from the threshold of movement up to a certain value of the applied stress. The experimental rates are then found to increase suddenly. This increase is attributed to the development of an additional suspended load. The abrupt development of a suspended load may be explained as due to a change in the nature of the fluid turbulence when the stationary boundary becomes occluded from the fluid flow by a concentrated layer of moving bed-load grains. The assumption that under these new moving-boundary conditions the available fluid energy derived from shearing over the bed is equally apportioned between bed-load and suspended-load transport work leads to values for the suspended-load transport rate which agree closely with the experimental data. A critical relation emerges between the gravity slope of the bed, the fall velocity and the mean transport velocity of the suspended grains at which their transport may become very large. Conditions are examined under which the steady transport may be possible of grains of heterogeneous size or density. Part III. When the fluid flow is non-inertial (laminar) and the grain flow is also non-inertial the semi-empirical relations found previously for the internal stresses are such that both viscosity and shear rate can be eliminated, and a differential equation obtained whose solution gives the grain concentration in terms only of distance from the bed and of the applied tangential stress. It appears that with constant applied stress (unlimited flow depth) the degree of grain dispersion greatly exceeds that to be expected in turbulent fluid flow. But when the applied stress diminishes linearly with distance from the bed boundary a possible solution gives constant grain concentration throughout the flow. This appears to explain certain experimental results, including the behaviour of 'slurries'. The effect is examined of a fixed or partially fixed bed on the grain flow in a turbulent fluid. The effect may be pronounced in the case of suspended grains. Under certain clearly definable conditions a loose grain bed must cease to remain stationary. And if the fluid flow above is turbulent the whole grain bed should flow at constant maximum concentration, underneath the flow proper and separated from it by a moving-bed surface interface at which the concentration is discontinuous. This explains phenomena sometimes found under river torrents. The factors giving rise to and limiting the development of bed features (dunes) on a bigger scale than ripples are examined. Dune formation appears as an inherent tendency of the grain flow alone, which may or may not be inhibited by the conditions of the fluid flow.},

abstract = {Gravel-river beds typically have an "armored" layer of coarse grains on the surface, which acts to protect finer particles underneath from erosion. River bed-load transport is a kind of dense granular flow, and such flows are known to vertically segregate grains. The contribution of granular physics to river-bed armoring, however, has not been investigated. Here we examine these connections in a laboratory river with bimodal sediment size, by tracking the motion of particles from the surface to deep inside the bed, and find that armor develops by two distinct mechanisms. Bed-load transport in the near-surface layer drives rapid segregation, with a vertical advection rate proportional to the granular shear rate. Creeping grains beneath the bed-load layer give rise to slow but persistent segregation, which is diffusion dominated and insensitive to shear rate. We verify these findings with a continuum phenomenological model and discrete element method simulations. Our results suggest that river beds armor by granular segregation from below --- rather than fluid-driven sorting from above --- while also providing new insights on the mechanics of segregation that are relevant to a wide range of granular flows.},

abstract = {Modern geomorphology was founded in the nineteenth century as an exercise of historical interpretation of landscapes. After the mid-twentieth century it dominantly became a quest to understand the processes by which landscapes are modified. This focused attention on the measurement of sediment fluxes on synoptic timescales and on a reductionist, Newtonian programme of construction of low-order theories about those fluxes, largely imported from engineering science. The period also saw the emergence of an applied geomor-phology. Toward the end of the twentieth century the subject was dramatically transformed by improved technologies for remote sensing and surveying of Earth's surface, the advent of personal computation and of large-scale computation, and important developments of absolute dating techniques. These technical inno-vations in turn promoted recognition of geomorphology as a 'system science' and facilitated the reintegration of tectonics into geomorphology, opening the way for a renewed consideration of the history of the land-scape. Finally, increasing recognition of the dominance of human agency in contemporary modification of Earth's terrestrial surface has become a significant theme. Important influences on the continuing develop-ment of the subject will include the search for physically sound laws for material fluxes; reconciling geomor-phological information and process representations across spatial and temporal scales, in both observation and theory; comprehending complexity in geomorphological processes and landform histories; incorporating the geomorphological role of living organisms, particularly micro-organisms; understanding the role of cli-mate in geomorphology, both in the contemporary changing climate and in the long term; and fully admitting the now dominant role of humans as geomorphic agents. Geomorphology is simultaneously developing in diverse directions: on one hand, it is becoming a more rigorous geophysical science – a significant part of a larger earth science discipline; on another, it is becoming more concerned with human social and economic values, with environmental change, conservation ethics, with the human impact on environment, and with issues of social justice and equity.

abstract = {The morphology of an alluvial river channel affects the movement of water and sediment along it, but in the longer run is shaped by those processes. This interplay has mostly been investigated empirically within the paradigm of Newtonian mechanics. In rivers, this has created an emphasis on equilibrium configurations with simple morphology and uniform steady flow. But transient adjustment, whether between equilibrium states or indefinitely, is to be expected in a world in which hydrology, sediment supply, and base level are not fixed. More fundamentally, water flows and all the phenomena that accompany them are inherently unsteady, and flows in natural channels are characteristically nonuniform. The morphodynamics of alluvial river channels is the striking consequence. In this paper, we develop the essential connection between the episodic nature of bed material transport and the production of river morphology, emphasizing the fundamental problems of sediment transport, the role of bar evolution in determining channel form, the role of riparian vegetation, and the wide range of time scales for change. As the key integrative exercise, we emphasize the importance of physics-based modeling of morphodynamics. We note consequences that can be of benefit to society if properly understood. These include the possibility to better be able to model how varying flows drive morphodynamic change, to understand the influence of the sediments themselves on morphodynamics, and to recognize the inherent necessity for rivers that transport bed material to deform laterally. We acknowledge pioneering contributions in WRR and elsewhere that have introduced some of these themes.},

abstract = {The entrainment of coarse sediment particles under the action of fluctuating hydrodynamic forces is investigated from an energy perspective. It is demonstrated that the entrainment of a grain resting on the channel boundary is possible when the instantaneous flow power transferred to it exceeds a critical level. Its complete removal from the bed matrix occurs only if the impinging flow events supply sufficient mechanical energy. The energy-based criterion is formulated theoretically for entrainment of individual spherical particles in both saltation and rolling modes. Out of the wide range of flow events that can perform mechanical work on a coarse grain, only those with sufficient power and duration or equivalent energy density and characteristic length scale may accomplish its complete dislodgement. The instantaneous velocity upstream of a mobile particle is synchronously recorded with its position, enabling the identification of the flow events responsible for grain entrainment by rolling at near incipient motion flow conditions. For each of the entrainment events, the energy transfer coefficient defined as the ratio of the mechanical work performed on the particle to the mean energy of the flow event responsible for its dislodgement obtains values ranging from 0.04 to 0.10. At the examined low-mobility flow conditions, the majority (about 80{\%}) of the energetic structures leading to complete particle entrainment have a characteristic length of about two to four particle diameters.},

Further, the sediment transport velocity, developed from available data, is explicitly tracked, and makes the equation suitable for unsteady events of sediment movement. The equation can be applied to multiple size fractions and ensures smooth transition of sediment variables between bed load and suspended load for each size fraction.

abstract = {Existing bed-load transport formulas may overestimate the transport rate in mountain rivers by two orders of magnitude or more. Recently published field data sets provide an opportunity to take a fresh look at the bed-load transport relationship and it is hypothesized that the overestimate is due to a failure to account for the effect of a coarse surface layer of bed material inhibiting the release of fine subsurface material. Bed-load transport is determined as gs=aq−qc where qwater discharge per unit width; qccritical value for initiation of bed material movement; water density; and acoefficient. The gs /q relationship is typically piecewise linear, characterized by two transport phases with, respectively, low and high rates of change. Twenty-one flume and 25 field data sets were used to quantify the relationship for Phase 2. The flume data confirm the dependence of a on S1.5, where Schannel slope, in agreement with earlier studies. The field data additionally show that a varies inversely with the degree of bed armoring, given by the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material size. The finding is consistent with the hypothesis and suggests the need to account for the bed material supply limitation in the bed-load transport formula. However, the available data are not entirely sufficient to rule out an alternative dependency, or codependency, on flow resistance. The critical conditions for initiation of Phase 2 transport are also quantified as a function of bed material size and channel slope. The resulting set of equations allows a more accurate estimation of Phase 2 bed-load transport rates. However, the equations are empirical and should be restricted for use within the range of conditions used in their development, to determine mean rather than instantaneous transport rates and to determine bulk transport rates, not transport by size fraction.},

abstract = {The paper reviews our recent attempts at modelling bed load transport in mountain rivers. This is a longstanding issue that has attracted considerable attention over the last century. While a number of field and laboratory studies have been instrumental in getting the big picture, there is a clear lack of efficient methods for predicting bed evolution and particle flux. Most approaches to bed load transport have emphasized the existence of a one-to-one relationship between the particle flux and water discharge, but this result conflicts with the spread of data, which often spans over several orders of magnitude. A possible interpretation lies in the significance of the fluctuations of the particle flux together with the propa-gation of bed forms. We have therefore developed a the-oretical model based on birth-death Markov processes to describe the random exchanges between the stream and bed, which then allows us to derive a governing equation for the particle flux fluctuations. We end up with the probability distribution function of the sediment trans-port rate. A striking feature is the existence of large fluctuations even under steady flow conditions. Numerical simulations have been carried out to com-pute the flow features, for the moment with no sediment transport. These simulations have shown that the kine-matic wave approximation (which leads to a significant simplification of the Saint-Venant equation into a non-linear advection equation) performs well for a wide range of water discharges. Remarkably, it has been found that under steady flow conditions, the local flow variables (wetted section and water discharge, or flow depth and mean velocity) exhibit a Froude similarity, i.e. regardless of the water discharge, the Froude number remains fairly constant at a given place of the river. Future work will consider the inclusion of a stochastic sediment transport equation in the Saint-Venant equations.},

abstract = {Despite several decades of investigations, accounting for the effect of the wide range of grain sizes composing the bed of rivers on bedload transport remains a challenging problem. We investigate this problem by studying experimentally the influence of grain size distribution on bedload transport in the simple configuration of a bimodal sediment bed composed of a mixture of 2 populations of quartz grains of sizes D-1 = 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm and D-2 = 2.2 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. The experiments are carried out in a tilted rectangular flume inside which the sediment bed is sheared by a steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we focus on the measurement of the average particle velocity and the surface density of moving particles, defined as the number of moving particles per unit surface of the bed. These two quantities are measured separately for each population of grains as a function of the dimensionless shear stress (or Shields number) and the fraction of the bed surface covered with small grains. We show that the average velocity and the surface density of moving particles obey the same equations as those reported by Lajeunesse et al. (2010) for a bed of homogeneous grain size. Once in motion, the grains follow therefore similar laws whether the bed is made of uniform sediment or of a bimodal mixture. This suggests that the erosion-deposition model established by Lajeunesse et al. (2010) for a bed of uniform sediment can be generalized to the case of a bimodal one. The only difference evidenced by our experiments concerns the critical Shields number for incipient sediment motion. Above a uniform sediment bed, the latter depends on the particle Reynolds number through the Shields curve. In the case of a bimodal bed, our experiments show that the critical Shields numbers of both populations of grains decrease linearly with the fraction of the bed surface covered with small grains. We propose a simple model to account for this observation.},

abstract = {The adjustment of a gravel bed during cycles of sediment storage was analyzed for a flume experiment, designed to study the effects of episodic sediment supply regimes. As the bed aggraded and degraded due to changes in sediment feed, it developed a complex topography with bedforms at different scales (e.g., pebble-clusters, bars). Sediment inputs increased bedload rates and promoted large changes in bed morphology. Without an external supply, the bed armored, which increased bed stability, counteracted bed degradation, and decreased bedload rates. Fully-mobile gravel (2–8 mm) was the only fraction that exhibited a deficit over the experiment. Preferential storage of coarse grains caused the development of a sediment wedge upstream and downstream fining on the bed surface. The storage of sand was also significant (60{\%} of feed) probably because of infiltration (e.g., in the upstream wedge) and hiding effects promoted by bed armor and structures. Size-selective transport caused a cumulative increase in bed slope, which was likely to affect sediment transport capacity. The large variability in bedload rates for same levels of bed storage indicated that sediment availability and bed state were the main controls on sediment transport regime. We provide empirical evidence that cycles of aggradation and degradation, caused by changes in sediment feed upstream, condition bed composition and topography, and the rate and texture of sediment output.},

@article{Wilcock2003a,
abstract = {Estimates of sediment transport rates in gravel-bed rivers are typically developed from formulae or from a sampling campaign. The former are notoriously inaccurate; the latter require a large effort and may still not achieve acceptable accuracy. A wide range of geomorphological problems, particularly those at the watershed scale, could be addressed more accurately if reliable local estimates of transport rate could be incorporated routinely into such studies. This requires a method for estimating transport rate with acceptable accuracy and a minimum of effort. A consistent approach to estimating transport is not just a matter of which formula or sampler to use; a suitable approach requires a consistent and reliable scaling of the water discharge and an integral description of the sediment that is both meaningful and practical. An approach proposed here, using a few observations of small transport rates to calibrate a transport formula, is likely to provide a superior combination of accuracy and effort and substantially reduces flow-scaling error. Small transport rates can be measured effectively using pit samplers, which allow the sampling periods needed for accurate measurements. Grain size can be represented as two fractions, sand and gravel, which capture some of the important transport dynamics and effectively represent important environmental problems within a tractable methodological approach. The approach is nearly independent of the uncertainty associated with measuring slope and bed grain-size in the field. Copyright},

abstract = {In this study we incorporate the existing concept of fractional mobility into a stochastic framework for modeling the partial transport of mixed-size sediment. The model predicts the fractional transport rates with parameters such as the long-run moving probability, mean particle velocity, and fractional mobility, all varying with the dimensionless effective shear stress. Movement of bed load particles is treated as a random combination of single-step motions described by the pseudo four-state continuous-time Markov process whose long-run moving probability can be evaluated with the instantaneous entrainment probability and ratio of mean single-step holding time. A most updated version of entrainment probability taking into account both the rolling and lifting modes is adopted; the ratio of mean holding time is determined with a physically based relation derived experimentally. Two types of experiments are performed in this study: the colored bed experiments are carried out to observe the fractional mobility and partial transport; the plain bed experiments are conducted to observe the single-step bed load motions and mean particle velocity. The proposed model is widely tested with laboratory and field data pertaining to both partial and full transport conditions, and reasonably good agreement between the predicted and observed results is demonstrated. The model is then applied to evaluate the fractional mobility and explore the influence of sand content. The results reveal that the relation between fractional mobility and dimensionless effective shear stress is well approximated by the cumulative lognormal distribution, with its mean and standard deviation linearly decreasing with sand content for the range {\textless}0.34. The results imply that the existence of fine-grained sand in the gravel-sand mixture is favorable to the mobilization of sediment. At higher sand content the condition of partial transport exists within a narrower range of flows such that full transport is easier to achieve. The present study is the first to investigate the effect of sand content on the fractional mobility, thus providing new insights into the process of partial transport.},

It is a rule-based cellular morphodynamic model, in contrast to reductionist models based on detailed computational fluid dynamics.

The outputs of the model include a depth-averaged flow field, water surface elevation and bed topography that evolve in time. Results show that DeltaRCM is able (1) to resolve a wide range of channel dynamics – including elongation, bifurcation, avulsion and migration – and (2) to produce a variety of deltas such as alluvial fan deltas and deltas with multiple orders of bifurcations. We also demonstrate a simple stratigraphy recording component which tracks the distribution of coarse and fine materials and the age of the deposits. Essential processes that must be included in reduced-complexity delta models include a depth-averaged flow field that guides sediment transport a nontrivial water surface profile that accounts for backwater effects at least in the main channels, both bedload and suspended sediment transport, and topographic steering of sediment transport.},

abstract = {Bedload, the transport of sediment remaining in contact with the stream bed, has mainly been studied from the perspective of the correlation between fluid driving forces and the responding sediment flux. Yet grain–grain interactions are important and bedload should also be considered as a granular phenomenon. We review progress made recently in the study of granular flows, especially on segregation and rheology, that better illuminates the nature of bedload. Granular flows may exhibit gas-like or fluid-like flow, or quasi-solid deformation. All three conditions might be duplicated in bedload. Understanding of intense bedload transport occurring continuously in a layer several grains deep – typical of sand beds – might greatly benefit from results in granular physics, as illustrated by grain-inspired bedload results. However, processes restricted to the surface of the bed, when particles move intermittently and the bed becomes structured, while characteristic in gravel-bed channels, are not well addressed in granular physics. Mutual study of these phenomena may benefit both physics and fluvial geomorphology. We intend, therefore, to contribute to an enhanced dialogue between granular physics and bedload science communities. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The influence of a past process on a geomorphic system is proportional to the intensity and duration of its action but inversely proportional to the time elapsed since the action. Tectonic movements are not reflected in a simple manner through individual slopes and gradients of landforms. Given areal uniformity of climate and tectonic history, uniformity of landform parameters characterizes regions of homogeneous geology, whereas contrasting landforms usually reflect areal variations in stratigraphy and structure.},

abstract = {Even under flow equilibrium conditions, river bed topography continuously evolves with time, producing trains of irregular bed forms. The idea has recently emerged that the variability in the bed form geometry results from some randomness in sediment flux. In this paper, we address this issue by using the Exner equation and a population exchange model derived in an earlier paper. In this model, particle entrainment and deposition are idealized as population exchanges between the stream and the bed, which makes it possible to use birth-death Markov process theory to track the number of moving grains. The paper focuses on nascent bed forms on initially planar beds, a situation in which the coupling between the stream and bed is weak. In a steady state, the number of moving particles follows a negative binomial distribution. Although this probability distribution does not enter the family of heavy-tailed distributions, it may give rise to large and frequent fluctuations because the standard deviation can be much larger than the mean, a feature that is not accounted for with classic probability laws (e.g., Hamamori's law) used so far for describing bed load fluctuations. In the large-system limit, the master equation of the birth-death Markov process can be transformed into a Fokker-Planck equation. This transformation is used here to show that the number of moving particles can be described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. An important consequence is that in the long term, the number of moving particles follows a Gaussian distribution. Laboratory experiments show that this approximation is correct when the mean number per unit length of stream, {\$}\backslashbar{\{}N{\}}{\$}/L, is sufficiently large (typically two particles per centimeter in our experiments). The particle number fluctuations give rise to bed elevation fluctuations, whose spectrum falls off like {\&}{\#}969;{\&}{\#}8722;2 in the high-frequency regime (with {\&}{\#}969; the angular frequency) and variance grows linearly with time. These features are in agreement with recent observations on bed form development (in particular, ripple growth).},

abstract = {An expert-based approach was used to identify 10 morphological unit types within a reach of the gravel bed, regulated Yuba River, California, that is heavily utilized by spawning Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Analysis of these units was carried out using two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, field-based geomorphic assessment, and detailed spawning surveying. Differently classified morphological units tended to exhibit discrete hydraulic signatures. In most cases, the Froude number adequately differentiated morphological units, but joint depth-velocity distributions proved the most effective hydraulic classification approach. Spawning activity was statistically differentiated at the mesoscale of the morphological unit. Salmon preferred lateral bar, riffle, and riffle entrance units. These units had moderately high velocity (unit median {\textgreater} 0.45 m s- 1) and low depth (unit median {\textless} 0.6 m), but each exhibited a unique joint depth-velocity distribution. A large proportion of redds (79{\%}) were associated with conditions of convective flow acceleration at riffle and riffle entrance locations. In addition to reflecting microhabitat requirements of fish, it was proposed that the hydraulic segregation of preferred from avoided or tolerated morphological units was linked to the mutual association of specific hydraulic conditions with suitable caliber sediment that promotes the provision and maintenance of spawning habitat. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Drag on a bed sediment particle was measured using a force sensor in a laboratory flume. The applied flow velocity was also measured using particle image velocimetry. A quasi-steady spectral model is proposed to predict the spectra of drag force on the particle using point velocity data. The quantity CDA (where CD and A are the coefficient of drag and exposed area of the particle, respectively), which was determined experimentally, is used in the model owing to practical limitations in estimating appropriate values of the individual quantities (CD and A). The predicted spectrum is found to closely match the measured force spectrum up to 1 Hz, indicating the important role of low-frequency streamwise velocity fluctuations in generating quasi-steady drag force on the particle. The model highlights the significance of increased nonlinearity due to higher-order streamwise velocity fluctuations beyond 10 Hz. However, the nonlinearity due to shedding of vortices at higher frequencies is accounted for by coupling the model with an admittance function based on the exposure of the particle. The coupled model is found to perform satisfactorily for all exposures, except when the particle is flushed with the bed. The limitation of the quasi-steady model at lower exposures is also supported by poor correlation between the measured velocity and force time histories.},

abstract = {In small and intermediate sized streams, the interaction between wood and bed material transport often determines the nature of the physical habitat, which in turn influences the health of the stream's ecosystem. We present a stochastic model that can be used to simulate the effects on physical habitat of forest fires, climate change, and other environmental disturbances that alter wood recruitment. The model predicts large wood (LW) loads in a stream as well as the volume of sediment stored by the wood; while it is parameterized to describe gravel bed streams similar to a well-studied field prototype, Fishtrap Creek, British Columbia, it can be calibrated to other systems as well. In the model, LW pieces are produced and modified over time as a result of random tree-fall, LW breakage, LW movement, and piece interaction to form LW jams. Each LW piece traps a portion of the annual bed material transport entering the reach and releases the stored sediment when the LW piece is entrained and moved. The equations governing sediment storage are based on a set of flume experiments also scaled to the field prototype. The model predicts wood loads ranging from 70 m3/ha to more than 300 m3/ha, with a mean value of 178 m3/ha: both the range and the mean value are consistent with field data from streams with similar riparian forest types and climate. The model also predicts an LW jam spacing that is consistent with field data. Furthermore, our modeling Results demonstrate that the high spatial and temporal variability in sediment storage, sediment transport, and channel morphology associated with LW-dominated streams occurs only when LW pieces interact and form jams. Model runs that do not include jam formation are much less variable. These Results suggest that river restoration efforts using engineered LW pieces that are fixed in place and not permitted to interact will be less successful at restoring the geomorphic processes responsible for producing diverse, productive physical habitats than efforts using LW pieces that are free to move, interact, and form LW jams. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

abstract = {Virtual process engineering (VPE) aims to redefine the roadmap for process scaling-up and optimization, from stepwise experiments to high-performance computer simulations. This is a long-cherished dream of chemical engineers, but requires high standards of Accuracy (the agreement between the simulation and the real process), Capability (the computational speed, scale, and resolution of the simulation), and Efficiency (cost-effective and easy to use), in short, ACE. For complex processes such as gas–solid fluidization, the gap between state-of-the-art simulations and VPE is still huge in terms of ACE. However, the work reported in this paper narrows this gap significantly. In this study, a coarse-grained discrete particle method (DPM) defined by the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is deployed for high-resolution simulations of fluidized beds, with the gas- and solid-phase equations solved concurrently by CPUs and GPUs in a heterogeneous supercomputing system. With systematic optimization of the model, numerical method, software, and hardware, we are able to simulate lab- to pilot-scale fluidized beds at quasi-realtime speed, and conduct virtual experiments on such systems. This enables very-long-time simulations to obtain important engineering parameters such as the particle residence time distribution, attrition and deactivation indexes. This work demonstrates that the industrial application of VPE is almost on the horizon.},

For almost a century, this onset has been treated as a discontinuous transition at which hydrodynamic forces overcome gravity-loaded grain-grain friction. Using a custom laminar-shear flume to image slow granular dynamics deep into the bed, here we find that the onset is instead a continuous transition from creeping to granular flow. This transition occurs inside the dense granular bed at a critical viscous number, similar to granular flows and colloidal suspensions and inconsistent with hydrodynamic frameworks. We propose a new phase diagram for sediment transport, where 'bed load' is a dense granular flow bounded by creep below and suspension above. Creep is characteristic of disordered solids and reminiscent of soil diffusion on hillslopes. Results provide new predictions for the onset and dynamics of sediment transport that challenge existing models.},

abstract = {Temporary storage of sediment within alluvial valley floors modulates the long-term transport of sediment through landscapes. The fate of weathering minerals or sediment-bound constituents in fluvial environments depends on the relative time scales of constituent degradation and particle residence time within valleys. Particles follow a set of trajectories through valley floors: some particles pass directly through the channel, reaching the basin outlet rapidly after being introduced to the fluvial system; others remain for long periods in deposits such as flood plains. Traditional sediment routing theory, based on the principle of sediment mass conservation along reaches of channel, does not account for exchanges of sediment with temporary sediment storage reservoirs outside the channel, such as flood plains, deltas, and alluvial fans. This article formalizes a theory that incorporates the role of such exchanges in the migration of sediment through river systems, by computing the probabilistic structure of particle trajectories through alluvial valley floors. Equations are developed for computing these trajectories from the sediment budget of a valley floor in steady state. Mathematical strategies for using such relationships to model transient storage conditions are proposed, and other potential model enhancements are discussed. The approach is illustrated using a hypothetical valley floor as an example. The theory can be used to examine rates of sediment overturn in valleys, map particle residence times, and account for the redistribution and decomposition of weathering minerals and particle-bound constituents. The theory has numerous potential management applications, some of which are discussed herein. The hypothetical example demonstrates that the probability distribution of particle residence times in the valleys of most alluvial rivers should be strongly right skewed.

abstract = {Based on the mechanics of the Euler equation at short time, we show that a Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure for the vorticity field, neglecting the early stage of advection of fluid particles, allows to build a 3D incompressible velocity field that shares many properties with empirical turbulence, such as the teardrop shape of the R-Q plane. Unfortunately, non gaussianity is weak (i.e. no intermittency) and vorticity gets preferentially aligned with the wrong eigenvector of the deformation. We then show that slightly modifying the former vectorial field in order to impose the long range correlated nature of turbulence allows to reproduce the main properties of stationary flows. Doing so, we end up with a realistic incompressible, skewed and intermittent velocity field that reproduces the main characteristics of 3D turbulence in the inertial range, including correct vorticity alignment properties.},

Since his pioneering work, numerous attempts have so far been made to study the sediment threshold both experimentally and theoretically.

abstract = {Bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers impacts channel stability, the lifespan of hydraulic structures, physical components of aquatic habitat, and long-term channel evolution. Field measurements of bedload transport are notoriously difficult, which precludes understanding many of the processes and mechanics associated with grain motion. Such uncertainties are exacerbated when using bedload transport equations, most of which were derived using data from a single river or set of laboratory flume experiments. Recently, laboratory experiments have focused on better quantifying the processes that impact bedload fluxes, which can then be used to improve sediment transport predictions. We highlight recent advances in laboratory instrumentation that can be used in bedload transport studies. In particular, more accurate ways to measure bedload fluxes, near-bed turbulence, bed grain sizes, and topography hold great promise. Laboratory experiments have also fundamentally improved our understanding of the influence of sediment supply and armoring processes on bedload fluxes and channel conditions. The importance of flow hydrographs in controlling total bedload transport rates and bedload hysteresis has also been demonstrated using flume experiments. Finally, many details about the mechanics of grain motion including flow turbulence, bed arrangement, and particle transport statistics are only possible through laboratory investigations, and we feature key knowledge gaps that can be improved with further study.},

abstract = {Single-molecule spectroscopy can monitor transitions between two microscopic states when these transitions are associated with the emission of photons. A general formalism is developed for obtaining the statistics of such transitions from a microscopic model when the dynamics is described by master or rate equations or their continuum analog, multidimensional reaction-diffusion equations. The focus is on the distribution of the number of transitions during a fixed observation time, the distribution of times between transitions, and the corresponding correlation functions. It is shown how these quantities are related to each other and how they can be explicitly calculated in a straightforward way for both immobile and diffusing molecules. Our formalism reduces to renewal theory when the monitored transitions either go to or originate from a single state. The influence of dynamics slow compared with the time between monitored transitions is treated in a simple way, and the probability distributions are expressed in terms of Mandel-type formulas. The formalism is illustrated by a detailed analysis of the statistics of catalytic turnovers of enzymes. When the rates of conformational changes are slower than the catalytic rates which are in turn slower than the binding relaxation rate, (1) the mean number of turnovers is shown to have the classical Michaelis-Menten form, (2) the correlation function of the number of turnovers is a direct measure of the time scale of catalytic rate fluctuations, and (3) the distribution of the time between consecutive turnovers is determined by the steady-state distribution.},

abstract = {A successful stream restoration design must be able to transport the sediment supplied to it with the available flow. Although this guidance is widely cited, only water supply is routinely incorporated in a consistent manner in restoration design. A number of factors can alter both the caliber and rate of sediment supply to a stream. Exact forecasts of sediment supply are seldom available and it is often possible to reliably estimate only the sign of changes in sediment supply. Channel design methodology, including estimates of sediment transport, must account for large uncertainty in future sediment supply. This paper examines sediment transport in coarse-bedded streams with the goal of identifying robust methods that provide reliable estimates of present and future transport. The response of bed composition and elevation to changes in sediment supply rate and caliber is examined. The accuracy and cost of methods for estimating sediment flux are evaluated. Emphasis is placed on determining the transport of different grain sizes, including the number of size fractions needed to adequately address potential channel change.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify a numerical method to simulate motion of a packed or fluidized bed of fuel particles in combustion chambers, such as a grate furnace and a rotary kiln. Therefore, the various numerical methods applied in the areas of granular matter and molecular dynamics were reviewed extensively. As a result, a time driven approach was found to be suited for the numerical simulation of particle motion in combustion chambers. Furthermore., this method can also be employed to moving boundaries which are required for the present application e.g. travelling grate. The method works in a Lagrangian frame of reference, which uses the position and orientation of particles as independent variables. These are obtained by time integration of the three-dimensional dynamics equations derived from the classical Newtonian approach for each particle. This includes the keeping track of all forces and momentums acting on each particle at every time step. Viscoelastic contact forces include normal and tangential components with viscoelastic models for energy dissipation and friction. The particle shapes are approximated by spheres and ellipsoids with a varying size and ratio of the semi-axis accounting for the variety of particle geometries in a combustion chamber. For these shapes the overlap of particles during contact is expressed by a polynomial of 4th order in the two-dimensional case and a polynomial of 6th order in the three-dimensional case. A new algorithm to detect two-dimensional elliptical particle contact with sufficient accuracy was developed. It is based on a sequence of coordinate transformations and has demonstrated its reliability in numerous applications. Finally, the method was applied to simulate the motion of spherical and elliptical particles in a rectangular enclosure, on a travelling grate, and in a rotary kiln.},

abstract = {Drag on a bed sediment particle was measured using a force sensor in a laboratory flume. The applied flow velocity was also measured using particle image velocimetry. A quasi-steady spectral model is proposed to predict the spectra of drag force on the particle using point velocity data. The quantity CDA (where CD and A are the coefficient of drag and exposed area of the particle, respectively), which was determined experimentally, is used in the model owing to practical limitations in estimating appropriate values of the individual quantities (CD and A). The predicted spectrum is found to closely match the measured force spectrum up to 1 Hz, indicating the important role of low-frequency streamwise velocity fluctuations in generating quasi-steady drag force on the particle. The model highlights the significance of increased nonlinearity due to higher-order streamwise velocity fluctuations beyond 10 Hz. However, the nonlinearity due to shedding of vortices at higher frequencies is accounted for by coupling the model with an admittance function based on the exposure of the particle. The coupled model is found to perform satisfactorily for all exposures, except when the particle is flushed with the bed. The limitation of the quasi-steady model at lower exposures is also supported by poor correlation between the measured velocity and force time histories.},

The stochastic differential equations derived have a few novel features, such as the possibility of pure imaginary noise terms and the possibility of higher order noise, which do not seem to have been previously studied by physicists.

In the numerical simulations of dune fields, we observe the formation and the evolution of superimposed bed forms on barchan and transverse dunes. Using the same model under different initial conditions, we perform the linear stability analysis of a flat sand bed disturbed by a small sinusoidal perturbation. Comparing the most unstable wavelength in the model with the characteristic size of secondary bed forms in nature, we determine the length and time scales of our cellular automaton model.

abstract = {The behaviour of granular material in motion is studied from a continuum point of view. Insofar as possible, individual grains are treated as the ‘molecules' of a granular ‘fluid'. Besides the obvious contrast in shape, size and mass, a key difference between true molecules and grains is that collisions of the latter are inevitably inelastic. This, together with the fact that the fluctuation velocity may be comparable to the flow velocity, necessitates explicit incorporation of the energy equation, in addition to the continuity and momentum equations, into the theoretical description. Simple ‘microscopic' kinetic models are invoked for deriving expressions for the ‘coefficients' of viscosity, thermal diffusivity and energy absorption due to collisions. The ‘coefficients' are not constants, but are functions of the local state of the medium, and therefore depend on the local ‘temperature' and density. In general the resulting equations are nonlinear and coupled. However, in the limit s [double less-than sign] d, where s is the mean separation between neighbouring grain surfaces and d is a grain diameter, the above equations become linear and can be solved analytically. An important dependent variable, in this formulation, in addition to the flow velocity u, is the mean random fluctuation (‘thermal') velocity {\$}\backslashbackslashoverline{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}v{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} of an individual grain. With a sufficient flux of energy supplied to the system through the boundaries of the container, {\$}\backslashbackslashoverline{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}v{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} can remain non-zero even in the absence of flow. The existence of a non-uniform {\$}\backslashbackslashoverline{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}v{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} is the means by which energy can be ‘conducted' from one part of the system to another. Because grain collisions are inelastic, there is a natural (damping) lengthscale, governed by the value of d, which strongly influences the functional dependence of {\$}\backslashbackslashoverline{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}v{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} on position. Several illustrative examples of static (u = 0) systems are solved. As an example of grain flow, various Couette-type problems are solved analytically. The pressure, shear stress, and ‘thermal' velocity function {\$}\backslashbackslashoverline{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}v{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} are all determined by the relative plate velocity U (and the boundary conditions). If {\$}\backslashbackslashoverline{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}v{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} is set equal to zero at both plates, the pressure and stress are both proportional to U2, i.e. the fluid is non-Newtonian. However, if sufficient energy is supplied externally through the walls ({\$}\backslashbackslashoverline{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}v{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}} \backslashbackslashne 0{\$} there), then the forces become proportional to the first power of U. Some examples of Couette flow are given which emphasize the large effect on the grain system properties of even a tiny amount of inelasticity in grain–grain collisions. From these calculations it is suggested that, for the case of Couette flow, the flow of sand is supersonic over most of the region between the confining plates.},

abstract = {We investigate the entrainment, deposition and motion of coarse spherical particles within a turbulent shallow water stream down a steep slope. This is an idealization of bed-load transport in mountain streams. Earlier investigations have described this kind of sediment transport using empirical correlations or concepts borrowed from continuum mechanics. The intermittent character of particle transport at low-water discharges led us to consider it as a random process. Sediment transport in this regime results from the imbalance between entrainment and deposition of particles rather than from momentum balance between water and particles. We develop a birthemigration Markov process to describe the particle exchanges between the bed and the water stream. A key feature of the model is its long autocorrelation times and wide, frequent fluctuations in the solid discharge, a phenomenon never previously explained despite its ubiquity in both nature and laboratory experiments. We present experimental data obtained using a nearly two-dimensional channel and glass beads as a substitute for sediment. Entrainment, trajectories, and deposition were monitored using a high-speed digital camera. The empirical probability distributions of the solid discharge and deposition frequency were properly described by the theoretical model. Experiments confirmed the existence of wide and frequent fluctuations of the solid discharge, and revealed the existence of long autocorrelation time, but theory overestimates the autocorrelation times by a factor of around three. Particle velocity was weakly dependent on the fluid velocity contrary to the predictions of the theoretical model, which performs well when a single particle is moving. For our experiments, the dependence of the solid discharge on the fluid velocity is entirely controlled by the number of moving particles rather than by their velocity. We also noted significant changes in the behaviour of particle transport when the bed slope or the water discharge was increased. The more vigorous the stream was, the more continuous the solid discharge became. Moreover, although 90{\%} of the energy supplied by gravity to the stream is dissipated by turbulence for slopes lower than 10{\%}, particles dissipate more and more energy when the bed slope is increased, but surprisingly, the dissipation rate is nearly independent of fluid velocity. A movie is available with the online version of the paper.},

abstract = {Scope.-The finer debris transported by a stream is borne in suspension. The coarser is swept along the channel bed. The suspended load is readily sampled and estimated, and much is known as to its quantity. The bed load is inaccessible and we are without definite information as to its amount. The primary purpose of the investigation was to learn the laws which control the movement of bed load, and especially to determine how the quantity of load is related to the stream's slope and discharge and to the degree of comminution of the debris. Method.-To this end a laboratory was equipped at Berkeley, Cal., and experiments were performed in which each of the three conditions mentioned was separately varied and the resulting variations of load were observed and measured. Sand and gravel were sorted by sieves into grades of uniform size. Determinate discharges were used. In each experiment a specific load was fed to a stream of specific width and discharge, and measurement was made of the slope to which the stream automatically adjusted its bed so as to enable the current to transport the load. The slope factor.-For each combination of discharge, width, and grade of debris there is a slope, called competent slope, which limits transportation. With lower slopes there is no load, or the stream has no capacity for load. With higher slopes capacity exists; and increase of slope gives increase of capacity. The value of capacity is approximately proportional to a power of the excess of slope above competent slope. If S equal the stream's slope and sigma equal competent slope, then the stream's capacity varies as (S - sigma)n. This is not a deductive, but an empiric law. The exponent n has not a fixed value, but an indefinite series of values depending on conditions. Its range of values in the experience of the laboratory is from 0.93 to 2.37, the values being greater as the discharges are smaller or the debris is coarser. The discharge factor.-For each combination of width, slope, and grade of debris there is a competent discharge, k. Calling the stream's discharge Q, the stream's capacity varies as (Q - k)o. The observed range of values for o is from 0.81 to 1.24, the values being greater as the slopes are smaller or the debris is coarser. Under like conditions o is less than n; or, in other words, capacity is less sensitive to change3 of discharge than to changes of slope. The fineness factor.-For each combination of width, slope, and discharge there is a limiting fineness of debris below which no transportation takes place. Calling fineness (or degree of comminution) F and competent fineness o, the stream's capacity varies with (F - o)p. The observed range of values for p is from 0.50 to 0.62, the values being greater as slopes and discharges are smaller. Capacity is less sensitive to changes in fineness of debris than to changes in discharge or slope. The form factor.-Most of the experiments were with straight channels. A few with crooked channels yielded nearly the same estimates of capacity. The ratio of depth to width is a more important factor. For any combination of slope, discharge, and fineness it is possible to reduce capacity to zero by making the stream very wide and shallow or very narrow and deep. Between these extremes is a particular ratio of depth to width, p, corresponding to a maximum capacity. The values of p range, under laboratory conditions, from 0.5 to 0.04, being greater as slope, discharge, and fineness are less. Velocity.-The velocity which determines capacity for bed load is that near the stream's bed, but attempts to measure bed velocity were not successful. Mean velocity was measured instead. To make a definite comparison between capacity and mean velocity it is necessary to postulate constancy in some accessory condition. If slope be the constant, in which case velocity changes with discharge, capacity varies on the average with the 3.2 power of velocity. If discharge be the constant, in which case velocity changes with slope, capacity varies on the average with the 4.0 power of velocity. If depth be the constant, in which case velocity changes with simultaneous changes of slope and discharge, capacity varies on the average with the 3.7 power of velocity. The power expressing the sensitiveness of capacity to changes of mean velocity has in each case a wide range of values, being greater as slope, discharge, and fineness are less. Mixtures.-In general, debris composed of particles of a single size is moved less freely than debris containing particles of many sizes. If fine material be added to coarse, not only is the total load increased but a greater quantity of the coarse material is carried. Modes of transportation; movement of particles.-Some particles of the bed load slide; many roll; the multitude make short skips or leaps, the process being called saltation. Saltation grades into suspension. When particles of many sizes are moved together the larger ones are rolled. Modes of transportation; collective movement.-When the conditions are such that the bed load is small, the bed is molded into hills, called dunes, which travel downstream. Their mode of advance is like that of eolian dunes, the current eroding their upstream faces and depositing the eroded material on the downstream faces. With any progressive change of conditions tending to increase the load, the dunes eventually disappear and the debris surface becomes smooth. The smooth phase is in turn succeeded by a second rhythmic phase, in which a system of hills travel upstream. These are called antidunes, and their movement is accomplished by erosion on the downstream face and deposition on the upstream face. Both rhythms of debris movement are initiated by rhythms of water movement. Application of formulas.-While the principles discovered in the laboratory are necessarily involved in the work of rivers, the laboratory formulas are not immediately available for the discussion of river problems. Being both empiric and complex, they will not bear extensive extrapolation. Under some circumstances they may be used to compare the work of one stream with that of another stream of the same type, but they do not permit an estimate of a river's capacity to be based on the determined capacities of laboratory streams. The investigation made an advance in the direction of its primary goal, but the goal was not reached. Load versus energy.-The energy of a stream is measured by the product of its discharge (mass per unit tune), its slope, and the acceleration of gravity. In a stream without load the energy is expended in flow resistances, which are greater as velocity and viscosity are greater. Load, including that carried in suspension and that dragged along the bed, affects the energy in three ways. (1) It adds its mass to the mass of the water and increases the stock of energy pro rata. (2) Its transportation involves mechanical work, and that work is at the expense of the stream's energy. (3) Its presence restricts the mobility of the water, in effect increasing its viscosity, and thus consumes energy. For the finest elements of load the third factor is more important than the second; for coarser elements the second is the more important. For each element the second and third together exceed the first, so that the net result is a tax on the stream's energy. Each element of load, by drawing on the supply of energy, reduces velocity and thus reduces capacity for all parts of the load. This principle affords a condition by which total capacity is limited. Subject to this condition a stream's load at any time is determined by the supply of debris and the fineness of the available kinds. Flume transportation.-In the experiments described above - experiments illustrating stream transportation - the load traversed a plastic bed composed of its own material. Other experiments were arranged in which the load traversed a rigid bed, the bottom of a flume. Capacities are notably larger for flume transportation than for stream transportation, and their laws of variation are different. Rolling is an important mode of progression. For rolled particles the capacity increases with coarseness, for leaping particles with fineness. Capacity increases with slope and usually with discharge also, but the rates of increase are less than in stream transportation. Capacity is reduced by roughness of bed. Vertical velocity curve.-The vertical distribution of velocities in a current is controlled by conditions. The level of maximum velocity may have any position in the upper three-fourths of the current. In loaded streams its position is higher as the load is greater. In unloaded streams its position is higher as the slope is steeper, as the discharge is greater, and as the bed is rougher. Pilot tube.-The constant of the Pitot velocity gage - the ratio between the head realized and the theoretic velocity head - is not the same in all parts of a conduit, being less near the water surface and greater near the bottom or side of the conduit.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}Springer International Publishing AG 2018. All rights reserved. This book presents key principles of the hydraulics of river basins, with a unique focus on the interplay between stream flows and sediment transport. Addressing a number of basic topics related to the hydraulics of natural waterways, it above all emphasizes applicative aspects in order to provide the reader with a solid grasp of river engineering. The first chapter explores many of the fixed base hydraulic topics that are normally neglected in traditional texts, namely the effects on motion produced by the vegetation and macroroughnesses that characterize many mountain streams. The remaining chapters are devoted entirely to hydraulics with mobile riverbeds and put particular emphasis on inhomogeneous river channels. The book's approach goes beyond classical treatments, so as to not only introduce readers to the fundamentals of mobile riverbeds, but also enable today's river engineers to successfully design and maintain natural riverbeds.},

abstract = {Particles transported as bed load within a specified streambed area possess at any instant a distribution of velocities. This distribution figures prominently in describing the rates of transport and dispersal of particles. High-speed imaging of sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed reveals that the probability density functions of the streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like. For quasi-steady conditions the exponential-like density of streamwise velocities reflects a balance among three fluxes in momentum space: (1) an advection of streamwise momentum whose magnitude and sign vary with the momentum state; (2) a diffusion of momentum from higher to lower values of momentum density; and (3) a drift of momentum from regions in momentum space having high average rates of generation of kinetic energy toward regions having low rates of generation of kinetic energy. The probability density of cross-stream velocities similarly reflects a balance of fluxes of cross-stream momentum. Whereas the average net force acting on particles is zero under steady conditions, the mean, variance and asymmetry of the distribution of forces acting on particles vary with the momentum state of the particles. Numerical simulations of particle motions that are faithful to these statistical properties reproduce key empirical results, namely, the exponential-like velocity distribution and the nonlinear relation between hop distances and travel times. The simulations also illustrate how steady gradients in particle activity, the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area, induce a diffusive flux as described in companion papers.},

In this paper, we investigate the plausibility of heavy-tailed movements for particles in bed load transport using carefully controlled flume experiments and theoretical analysis. In our experimental setting, we find travel distances for particles of a given size follow an exponential distribution whose mean varies with grain size. Building on previous work of Stark et al.

Heavy-tailed travel distance can lead to anomalous diffusion in bed load transport, modeled by fractional derivatives in the transport equation.},

It uses 2D mathematical descriptions to restore and characterize 3D shape and surface morphology of sediment particles in terms of the "mathematical sediment", so as to better understand 3D geometric characteristics reflected by single sediment particles. To prevent the simplification of morphology description and overcome the deficiencies of lower-dimensional characteristics, we proposed a concept of "mathematical sediment" in this paper. The mathematical sediment uses image analysis of scanning electron microscope photographs and complex Fourier shape analysis to describe the planar projection shape of sediment particles and further restore the 3D morphology of sediment particles through a certain combination ways. The shapes of sediment particles are controlled using Fourier coefficients to generate a variety of mathematical sediments with various shapes, which allow the realization of the description and analysis of the 3D morphology of sediment particles. The fractal theory is further used to verify the rationality of mathematical sediment. Compared with the traditional method, the mathematical sediment overcomes the lack of particle system and smooth sphere systems and can reproduce 3D irregular surfaces for the morphology analysis. The rationality verification showed that the complex surface morphology of mathematical sediment is basically similar to the surface morphology of natural sediment. The mathematical sediment can reflect the true surface characteristics of sediment particles. The characteristics of shape properties and surface morphology it conveys are consistent with the natural sediment and can be used as a research basis for the further study both in fresh water and marine.},

abstract = {When a ball moves through the air, the air exerts a force on the ball. For a sphere moving at constant velocity with respect to the air, this force is called the drag force and it has been well measured. If the sphere moves with a nonconstant velocity there are additional forces. These “unsteady” forces depend on the sphere's acceleration and, in principle, also on higher derivatives of the motion. The force equal to a constant times the acceleration is called the “added mass” because it increases the effective inertia of the sphere moving through the fluid. We measure the unsteady forces on a sphere by observing the one- and two-dimensional projectile motion of light spheres around the highest point. The one-dimensional motion is well described by just the usual buoyant force and the added mass as calculated in the ideal fluid model. This measurement is an excellent experiment for introductory physics students. For spheres in two-dimensional projectile motion the downward vertical acceleration at the highest point increases with the horizontal velocity. This effect can be described by an additional force proportional to the speed times the acceleration.},

abstract = {One way to study the mechanism of gravel bed load transport is to seed the bed with marked gravel tracer particles within a chosen patch and to follow the pattern of migration and dispersal of particles from this patch. In this study, we invoke the probabilistic Exner equation for sediment conservation of bed gravel, formulated in terms of the difference between the rate of entrainment of gravel into motion and the rate of deposition from motion. Assuming an active layer formulation, stochasticity in particle motion is introduced by considering the step length (distance traveled by a particle once entrained until it is deposited) as a random variable. For step lengths with a relatively thin (e.g., exponential) tail, the above formulation leads to the standard advection-diffusion equation for tracer dispersal. However, the complexity of rivers, characterized by a broad distribution of particle sizes and extreme flood events, can give rise to a heavy-tailed distribution of step lengths. This consideration leads to an anomalous advection-diffusion equation involving fractional derivatives. By identifying the probabilistic Exner equation as a forward Kolmogorov equation for the location of a randomly selected tracer particle, a stochastic model describing the temporal evolution of the relative concentrations is developed. The normal and anomalous advection-diffusion equations are revealed as its long-time asymptotic solution. Sample numerical results illustrate the large differences that can arise in predicted tracer concentrations under the normal and anomalous diffusion models. They highlight the need for intensive data collection efforts to aid the selection of the appropriate model in real rivers.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the role of turbulence fluctuations on the entrainment of a fully exposed grain near threshold flow conditions. Experiments were carried out to measure synchronously the near bed flow velocity and the particle movement for a range of flow conditions and resulting particle entrainment frequencies. We used a simplified bed geometry consisted of spherical particles to reduce the complexities associated with the variations in the bed and flow details in an effort to identify the underlying dominant physical mechanism. An analysis was performed based on common force approximations using near bed flow velocity. Turbulence fluctuations were treated as impulses, which are products of magnitude and duration of applied force. It is demonstrated that besides the magnitude of the instantaneous forces applied on a sediment grain, their duration is important as well in determining whether a particle will be entrained by a turbulent flow event. Frequency of particle entrainment varied remarkably with minute changes in gross flow parameters. Impulse imparted on the sediment grain by turbulent flow was found to be well represented by a log-normal distribution. We obtained a (log-normal) probability density function (pdf) dependent on only the coefficient of variation of the impulse (impulse intensity). Relation of the impulse intensity to the particle Reynolds number, Re∗, was established. The sensitivity of the computed impulse to the critical force level, as well as the influence of the critical impulse level on the dislodgement events, was explored. Particle entrainment probabilities were found using the derived pdf as well as experimental observations and a good agreement between the two is reported. Implications of the presented impulse concept and our experimental findings for sediment mobility at low bed shear stress conditions are also discussed.},

It was found that, to a large$\backslash$nextent, fluctuations reflected the finite size of the observation$\backslash$nwindow. For fixed beds, the characteristic time scale of fluctuations$\backslash$nand their probability distribution can be predetermined by evaluating$\backslash$nthe mean and fluctuating velocities of a single particle. Solid-discharge$\backslash$nfluctuations were exacerbated when the bed was mobile because (i)$\backslash$nthe moving solid phase and the stationary bed exchanged particles$\backslash$nand (ii) collective entrainment of particles occurred.},

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL datasets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin- sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI-SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a generalized Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) (gLoG) filter for detecting general elliptical blob structures in images. The gLoG filter can not only accurately locate the blob centers but also estimate the scales, shapes, and orientations of the detected blobs. These functions can be realized by generalizing the common 3-D LoG scale-space blob detector to a 5-D gLoG scale-space one, where the five parameters are image-domain coordinates (x, y), scales ($\sigma$(x), $\sigma$(y)), and orientation ($\theta$), respectively. Instead of searching the local extrema of the image's 5-D gLoG scale space for locating blobs, a more feasible solution is given by locating the local maxima of an intermediate map, which is obtained by aggregating the log-scale-normalized convolution responses of each individual gLoG filter. The proposed gLoG-based blob detector is applied to both biomedical images and natural ones such as general road-scene images. For the biomedical applications on pathological and fluorescent microscopic images, the gLoG blob detector can accurately detect the centers and estimate the sizes and orientations of cell nuclei. These centers are utilized as markers for a watershed-based touching-cell splitting method to split touching nuclei and counting cells in segmentation-free images. For the application on road images, the proposed detector can produce promising estimation of texture orientations, achieving an accurate texture-based road vanishing point detection method. The implementation of our method is quite straightforward due to a very small number of tunable parameters.},

abstract = {With the growth of available computational resource, CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) becomes an increasingly promising and feasible approach for the study of sediment transport. Several existing CFD-DEM solvers are applied in chemical engineering and mining industry. However, a robust CFD-DEM solver for the simulation of sediment transport is still desirable. In this work, the development of a three-dimensional, massively parallel, and open-source CFD-DEM solver SediFoam is detailed. This solver is built based on open-source solvers OpenFOAM and LAMMPS. OpenFOAM is a CFD toolbox that can perform three-dimensional fluid flow simulations on unstructured meshes; LAMMPS is a massively parallel DEM solver for molecular dynamics. Several validation tests of SediFoam are performed using cases of a wide range of complexities. The results obtained in the present simulations are consistent with those in the literature, which demonstrates the capability of SediFoam for sediment transport applications. In addition to the validation test, the parallel efficiency of SediFoam is studied to test the performance of the code for large-scale and complex simulations. The parallel efficiency tests show that the scalability of SediFoam is satisfactory in the simulations using up to O(107) particles.},

abstract = {High-speed imaging of coarse sand particles transported as bed load reveals how particle motions possess intrinsic periodicities associated with their start-and-stop behavior. The dominant harmonics in these motions have a primary influence on the rate at which the mean squared particle displacement R(tau) - a measure conventionally used to assess the possibility of anomalous diffusion - increases with the time interval tau. Over a timescale corresponding to the typical travel time of particles, calculations of R(tau) may ostensibly indicate non-Fickian behavior while actually reflecting the effects of periodicities in particle motions, not anomalous diffusion. We provide the theoretical basis for this observed behavior, and we illustrate how the effective (Fickian) particle diffusivity obtains from G. I. Taylor's classic definition involving the particle velocity autocovariance, including its relation to the ensemble-averaged particle velocity as articulated by O. M. Phillips. Cross-stream diffusivities are an order of magnitude smaller than streamwise diffusivities.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A 3D Lagrangian model of the saltation of solid spherical particles on the bed of an open channel flow, accounting for turbulence-induced mechanisms, is proposed and employed as the key tool of the study. The differences between conventional 2D models and a proposed 3D saltation model are discussed and the advantages of the 3D model are highlighted. Particularly, the 3D model includes a special procedure allowing generation of 3D flow velocity fields. This procedure is based on the assumption that the spectra of streamwise, vertical and transverse velocity components are known at any distance from the bed. The 3D model was used to identify and quantify effects of turbulence on particle entrainment and saltation. The analysis of particle trajectories focused on their diffusive nature, clarifying: (i) the effect of particle mobility parameter; (ii) the effect of bed topography; and (iii) the effect of turbulence. Specifically, the results of numerical simulations describing the abovementioned effects on the change in time of the variance are presented. In addition, the change in time of the skewness and kurtosis, which are likely to reflect the turbulence influence on the spread of particles, are also shown. Two different diffusion regimes (local and intermediate) for each of the investigated flow conditions are confidently identified.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

@article{Lisle1992,
abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of the origin and function of armouring in gravel-bed rivers have not addressed the role of non-uniformity and unsteadiness of flow. These flow attributes have important influences on both the surface and subsurface bed material size distributions which are observed at low flow, from which we commonly make inferences concerning bedload transport at high flow. Bed armouring, measured as the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material grain size, is highly variable spatially in a channel in which past and present bed aggradation indicates that the sediment supply has exceeded the transport capacity. Alternate bar topography induces strong variations in boundary shear stress, especially at low flow. The resulting winnowing of fine sediment from zones of high stress, such as riffles, and its deposition as thin sheets in zones of low stress, such as pools, produce wide variations in armouring. Linked winnowing and deposition of fine sediment in each bar pool sequence creates pronounced, local, streamwise sorting by grain size. Streamwise sorting can lead to pronounced apparent size-selectivity in bedload transport during subsequent rising stages. The relatively fine bedload transported during initial rising stages can originate from unarmoured deposits of fines, where all particle sizes present on the bed surface may be nearly equally mobile. These surfaces are devoid of larger particles, however, that appear in the bedload only when coarser armoured surfaces become more widely entrained. 13.1},

abstract = {We present a new 3-D cellular automaton model for bed form dynamics in which individual physical processes such as erosion, deposition, and transport are implemented by nearest neighbor interactions and a time-dependent stochastic process. Simultaneously,a lattice gas cellular automaton model is used to compute the flow and quantify the bed shear stress on the topography. Local erosion rates are assumed to be proportional to the shear stress in such a way that there is a complete feedback mechanism between flow and bed form dynamics. In the numerical simulations of dune fields, we observe the formation and the evolution of superimposed bed forms on barchan and transverse dunes. Using the same model under different initial conditions, we perform the linear stability analysis of a flat sand bed disturbed by a small sinusoidal perturbation. Comparing the most unstable wavelength in the model with the characteristic size of secondary bed forms in nature, we determine the length and time scales of our cellular automaton model. Thus, we establish a link between discrete and continuous approaches and open new perspectives for modeling and quantification of complex patterns in dune fields.},

abstract = {Stochastic chemical kinetics describes the time evolution of a well-stirred chemically reacting system in a way that takes into account the fact that molecules come in whole numbers and exhibit some degree of randomness in their dynamical behavior. Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

abstract = {Rifflepool sequences are maintained through the preferential entrainment of sediment grains from pools rather than riffles. This preferential entrainment has been attributed to a reversal in the magnitude of velocity and shear stress under high flows; however the Differential Sediment Entrainment Hypothesis (DSEH) postulates that differential entrainment can instead result from spatial sedimentological contrasts. Here we use a novel suite of in situ grain-scale field measurements from a rifflepool sequence to parameterize a physically-based model of grain entrainment. Field measurements include pivoting angles, lift forces and high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired using terrestrial laser scanning, from which particle exposure, protrusion and surface roughness were derived. The entrainment model results show that grains in pools have a lower critical entrainment shear stress than grains in either pool exits or riffles. This is because pool grains have looser packing, hence greater exposure and lower pivoting angles. Conversely, riffle and pool exit grains have denser packing, lower exposure and higher pivoting angles. A cohesive matrix further stabilizes pool exit grains. The resulting predictions of critical entrainment shear stress for grains in different subunits are compared with spatial patterns of bed shear stress derived from a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reach. The CFD model predicts that, under bankfull conditions, pools experience lower shear stresses than riffles and pool exits. However, the difference in sediment entrainment shear stress is sufficiently large that sediment in pools is still more likely to be entrained than sediment in pool exits or riffles, resulting in differential entrainment under bankfull flows. Significantly, this differential entrainment does not require a reversal in flow velocities or shear stress, suggesting that sedimentological contrasts alone may be sufficient for the maintenance of rifflepool sequences. This finding has implications for the prediction of sediment transport and the morphological evolution of gravel-bed rivers. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We report an experimental investigation of the motion of bed load particles under steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow above a flat sediment bed of uniform grain size. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we recorded the trajectories of the moving particles and measured their velocity and the length and duration of their flights, as well as the surface density of the moving particles. Our observations show that entrained particles exhibit intermittent motion composed of the succession of periods of {\&}8220;flight{\&}8221; and periods of rest. During one flight, a particle may go through phases of reptation, during which it moves in nearly persistent contact with the rough bed, and phases of saltation, during which it travels sufficiently high above the bed to reach high velocities. The distributions of longitudinal and transverse particle velocities obey a decreasing exponential and a Gaussian law, respectively. Interestingly, these observations are similar to those previously reported for viscous flows. The experimental results presented here support the erosion-deposition model of Charru (2006) and allow the calibration of the involved coefficients. In particular, noting {\&}964;, the Shields number, and {\&}964;c, the threshold Shields number, we find that (1) the surface density of moving particles increases linearly with {\&}964; {\&}8722; {\&}964;c; (2) the average particle velocity increases linearly with {\&}964;1/2 {\&}8722; {\&}964;c1/2, with a finite nonzero value at the threshold; (3) the flight duration scales with a characteristic settling time with no significant dependence on either {\&}964; or the settling Reynolds number; and (4) the flight length increases linearly with {\&}964;1/2 {\&}8722; {\&}964;c1/2. The results presented in this paper should provide a valuable physical framework to describe bed form development in turbulent flows.},

We focus on sheet flows in which the particles are supported by their collisional interactions rather than by the velocity fluctuations of the turbulent fluid and introduce what we believe to be the simplest theory for the collisional regime that captures its essential features.We employ a relatively simple model of the turbulent shearing of the fluid and use kinetic theory for the collisional grain flow to predict profiles of the mean fluid velocity, the mean particle velocity, the particle concentration, and the strength of the particle velocity fluctuations within the sheet. These profiles are obtained as solutions to the equations of balance of fluid and particle momentum and particle fluctuation energy over a range of Shields parameters between 0.5 and 2.5. We compare the predicted thickness of the concentrated region and the predicted features of the profile of the mean fluid velocity with those measured by Sumer et al. (1996). In addition, we calculate the volume flux of particles in the sheet as a function of Shields parameter.Finally, we apply the theory to sand grains in air for the conditions of a sandstorm and calculate profiles of particle concentration, velocity, and local volume flux.},

The runs were carried out by measuring, with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, the turbulence intensity profile along six verticals of a given cross section in a laboratory flume. The analysis of the measured intensity distributions has shown the existence of two different regions, above and below the tops of the roughness elements, in which different intensity profiles occur. Furthermore, the measured profiles have shown a maximum of the turbulence intensity that decreases for increasing values of the roughness height, confirming that the turbulence damping efficiency increases when the roughness elements protrude inside the flow. The applicability of Nezu's relationship ?derived for a hydraulically smooth bed? for the experimental intensity profiles above the roughness elements is positively tested. Finally a new intensity distribution for a rough bed, applicable to the whole water depth, is proposed. In this profile, two coefficients having a known physical meaning ?the maximum turbulence intensity and the depth at which this maximum is located? appear.},

Because they account for temporal aspects of the applied hydrodynamic forces, impulse-based or energy-based approaches provide a better representation of a highly fluctuating phenomenon compared to the more traditional time-averaged Shields parameter or constant force magnitude-based model. In the present paper, we elaborate further on the simulation of particle migration by applying a theoretical model based on hydrodynamic pressure data. Three common movement scenarios and the dynamic critical drag force, allowed to vary during particle motion, are qualitatively discussed here. Also, the possible inaccuracy in entrainment prediction of three different models is addressed with reference to our simulation results. It is demonstrated that the multi-parcel impulse model has the best performance when compared to the single-parcel impulse and force magnitude-based models.},

Because of the size and shape of this structure, the ECF will alter local flowhydraulic conditions and isolate local discharges and intakes from free interaction with the open water of the harbour. To investigate the impact and functionality of the ECF, a three- dimensional (3D) hydraulic model was adopted in this study. The model was verified against vertical velocity profiles measured with an acoustic doppler current profiler in the study region. Results of the verification reveal that under the driving force of wind, the best agreement between simulated and measured currents occurs in the surface layer. Considering the complex nature of the hydraulic conditions in the harbour, the model performs reasonably well. Overall, the model should provide a useful tool considering and comparing hydraulic con- ditions under different ECF configurations and the existing condition. The functionality of a newly created connection channel used for the purpose of improving local water quality was studied in detail with some unexpected discoveries.},

We present a review of recent results from our previous works, which led to physical insights on these phenomena. These results were obtained from a systematic numerical study based on the accurate resolution - Direct Numerical Simulation via a pseudo-spectral approach - of the turbulent flow field, and on Lagrangian tracking of particles under different modelling assumptions. We underline the multiscale aspect of wall turbulence, which has challenged scientists to devise simple theoretical models adequate to fit experimental data, and we show that a sound rendering of wall turbulence mechanisms is required to produce a physical understanding of particle deposition and re-entrainment. This physical understanding can be implemented in more applied simulation techniques, such as Large-Eddy Simulation. Our arguments are based also on the phenomenology of coherent structures and on the examination of flow topology in connection with particle preferential distribution. Starting from these concepts, reasons why theoretical predictions may fail are examined together with the requirements which must be fulfilled by suitable predictive models. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ideas deriving from the standard formulation for continuous time random walk (CTRW) based on the Montroll-Weiss Master Equation (ME) have been recently applied to transport and diffusion of river tracer pebbles. CTRW, accompanied by appropriate probability density functions (PDFs) for walker step length and waiting time, yields asymptotically the standard advection-diffusion equation (ADE) for thin-tailed PDFs and the fractional advection-diffusion equation (fADE) for heavy-tailed PDFs, the latter allowing the possibilities of subdiffusion or superdiffusion. Here we show that the CTRW ME is inappropriate for river pebbles moving as bed load: a deposited particle raises local bed elevation, and an entrained particle lowers it so that particles interact with the lattice of the sediment-water interface. We use the Parker-Paola-Leclair framework, which is a probabilistic formulation of the Exner equation of sediment conservation, to develop a new ME for tracer transport and dispersion for alluvial morphodynamics. The formulation is based on the existence of a mean bed elevation averaged over fluctuations. The new ME yields asymptotic forms for ADE and fADE that differ significantly from CTRW. It allows vertical as well as streamwise advection-diffusion. Vertical dispersion is nonlocal but cannot be expressed with fractional derivatives. In order to illustrate the new model, we apply it to the restricted case of vertical dispersion only, with both thin and heavy tails for relevant PDFs. Vertical dispersion shows a subdiffusive behavior.},

abstract = {Field measurements of sediment transport in gravel bed rivers often reveal hysteretic effects due to differences in sediment availability between the rising and falling limbs of a flood hydrograph. However, only a small number of flume studies have analyzed the dynamics of sediment transport during hydrographs. Three types of stepped hydrographs with contrasting durations and magnitudes are simulated here under sediment recirculation conditions. Bed load transport rate and grain size have been measured continuously. The dynamic behavior of the surface armor layer has been explored by analyzing digital photographs and laser scanner surveys of the bed surface taken during hydrographs. The results indicate that sediment transport during the falling limb was lower than during the rising limb in all of the three types of hydrographs. This reduction is more evident for the low-magnitude hydrographs. The grain size of the bed remained virtually constant throughout the hydrographs but the grain size of transported sediments exhibited a counterclockwise hysteresis. Also, a significant increase in the reference shear stress for sediment entrainment was measured during the falling limb of hydrographs. Additionally, a detailed analysis of partial transport dynamics of the bed surface sediments reveals a reduction in sediment mobility during the falling limb of the hydrographs. The difference in sediment entrainment and transport before and after the peak of the hydrographs appears to be caused by a change in the organization of the surface sediments. An analysis of detailed laser scan bed surveys reveals a phase of bed restructuring (lower vertical roughness, clast rearrangement) during the falling limb of hydrographs. Consequently, changes in the degree of organization and complexity of the bed surface are likely the cause of the reduced mobility of sediments, and thus of the reduced sediment transport rate, during the falling limb of the hydrographs.

The less obvious indirect effects of point and reach changes occurring downstream and throughout the basin, however, are much more recently appreciated, dating from key contributions by Strahler [Strahler, A.N., 1956. The nature of induced erosion and aggradation. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 621-638.], Wolman [Wolman, M.G., 1967. A cycle of sedimentation and erosion in urban river channels. Geografiska Annaler 49A, 385-95.], Schumm [Schumm, S.A., 1969. River metamorphosis. Proceedings American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal Hydraulics Division 95, 255-73.], and Graf [Graf, W.L., 1977. The rate law in fluvial geomorphology. American Journal of Science, 277, 178-191.]. These are complemented by effects of alterations of land use, such as deforestation, intensive agriculture and incidence of fire, with the most extreme effects produced by building activity and urbanisation. Changing river channels are most evident in the channel cross-section where changes of size, shape and composition are now well-established, with up to tenfold increases or decreases illustrated by results from more than 200 world studies. In addition the overall channel planform, the network and the ecology have changed. Specific terms have become associated with changing river channels including enlargement, shrinkage and metamorphosis. Although the scope of adjustment has been established, it has not always been possible to predict what will happen in a particular location, because of complex response and contingency. The ways in which changes in cross-section relate to reach and network changes are less clear, despite investigations showing the distribution of changes along segmented channels. When considering the human role in relation to changing river channels, at least five challenges persist. First, because prediction of the nature and amount of likely change at a particular location is not certain, and because the contrasting responses of humid and arid systems needs to be considered, modelling is required to reduce uncertainty, as was first emphasised by Burkham [Burkham, D.E., 1981. Uncertainties resulting from changes in river form. American Society Civil Engineers Proceedings, Journal Hydraulics Division 107, 593-610.]. Second, feedback effects incorporated within the relationship between changes at channel, reach and network scales can have considerable implications, especially because changes now evident may have occurred, or have been initiated, under different environmental conditions. Third, consideration of global climate change is imperative when considering channel sensitivity and responses to threshold conditions. Fourth, channel design involving geomorphology should now be an integral part of restoration procedures. This requires, fifthly, greater awareness of different cultures as a basis for understanding constraints imposed by legislative frameworks. Better understanding of the ways in which the perception of the human role in changing river channels varies with culture as well as varying over time should enhance application of design for river channel landscapes. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

The lognormally distributed instantaneous velocity and uniformly distributed initial grain position, along with a relation between lift coefficient and particle Reynolds number, are used to extend the theoretical formulation of the entrainment probabilities in smooth-bed flows. The two threshold conditions identified herein enable us to precisely define the probabilities of entrainment in the rolling and lifting modes. The results obtained in this study coincide well with the published data. The lifting probability increases monotonously with the dimensionless shear stress theta, which is consistent with the earlier results yet displays improved agreement with the experimental data. The maximum value of rolling probability, with a magnitude of 0.25, occurs at theta approximate to0.15. For theta{\textless}0.05 (or {\&}theta;{\textgreater}0.6), the rotting (or lifting) probability makes up more than 90{\%} of the total entrainment probability and thus can be used as an approximation to the total probability of entrainment. The proposed rolling and lifting probabilities are further linked to the two separate criteria for incipient motion to explore the critical entrainment probabilities. The results reveal that a consistent probability corresponding to the critical state of sediment entrainment cannot be found.},

abstract = {A minimal Lagrangian two-phase model to study turbulent bedload transport focus- ing on the granular phase is presented and validated with experiments. The model intends to describe bedload transport of massive particles in fully rough flows at relatively low Shields numbers, for which no suspension occurs. A discrete element method for the granular phase is coupled with a one dimensional volume-averaged two-phasemomentum equation for the fluid phase. The coupling between the discrete granular phase and the continuous fluid phase is discussed, and a consistent averaging formulation adapted to bedload transport is introduced. An original simple discrete random walk model is proposed to account for the fluid velocity fluctuations. The model is compared with experiments considering both classical sediment transport rate as a function of the Shields number, and depth profiles of solid velocity, volume fraction, and transport rate density, from existing bedload transport experiments in inclined flume. The results successfully reproduce the classical 3/2 power law, and more importantly describe well the depth profiles of the granular phase, showing that the model is able to reproduce the particle scale mechanisms. From a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the fluctuation model allows to reproduce a realistic critical Shields number, and that the influence of the granular parameters on the macroscopic results is weak. Nevertheless, the analysis of the corresponding depth profiles reveals an evolution of the depth structure of the granular phase with varying restitution and friction coefficients, which denotes the non-trivial underlying physical mechanisms.},

Experiments were performed tracking individual particles under different bed conditions (mobile and fixed beds) at transitional hydrodynamic regimes. A new image processing procedure was designed to obtain the coordinates of each moving sediment within the intermediate range of scales (corresponding to a particle trajectory between rests periods). Thorough attention has been paid to provide consistent definitions for particle motion and trajectory, as well as to devise a rigorous method for analysis. A data set with properties of more than 4000 intermediate trajectories was obtained. Collected data were used to estimate stream-wise and transversal length and duration of intermediate trajectories and corresponding mean sediment velocities. Statistical significance of the values obtained for measured properties was ascertained by appropriate analysis. The full data set is provided with the manuscript as supplementary material.},

@article{Sayre1965,
abstract = {One significant facet of the disposal of radioactive wastes in alluvial streams pertains to the influence that natural sediments have on the transport and dispersion of radioactive wastes. The sorption of radioactive wastes by clay, silt, and sand (par ticularly clay-coated sand) is a common phenomenon; hence, the transport and dispersion of waste can be affected to a significant extent by the transport and dispersion of the individual sediment particles. To study the transport and dispersion of bed-material particles (sand), an experiment was conducted in the North Loup River near Purdum, Nebr. In the experiment, sand labeled with radioactive iridium 192 was released from a line source on the bed of the river. After release, the movement of the tracer particles downstream was observed by monitoring the streambed with a sled-mounted scintillation detector. In addition, the vertical distribution of the tracer particles in the bed was observed by monitoring core samples of the bed material. The amount of activity and the number of tracer particles used in the experiment were determined from detailed calibrations in which field conditions were simulated. The tracer particles varied within a fairly narrow range about a median fall diameter of 0.305 mm. The size of the tracer particles was selected so that they would be slightly coarser than the dominant size range of the bed material. Longitudinal traverses with the radiation detection equipment at approximately daily intervals and extending over a 13-day period defined the dispersion of tracer particles along the channel. The traverses also indicated that some of the tracer particles were buried as a concentrated deposit for about 7 days. Presumably, these tracer particles were deposited in an unusually deep dune trough and were not reexposed until a similarly deep trough passed by. The tem porary burial of the tracer particles demonstrates that deposits of contaminated particles in an alluvial stream can remain un disturbed for relatively long periods of time and then suddenly be released. A concentration-distribution function, which is based on probability theory, was derived to characterize the dispersion process. The parameters of the function are related to the dispersion time and distance. Significant characteristics of the function are that the variance and the mean of the distribution are proportional to time and that for large times the maximum concentration varies inversely with the square root of time. Comparable observed and theoretical distributions agreed well except near the origin and at the downstream tail. The explana tion for the differences is based on certain discrepancies betweenphysical features of the experiment and the corresponding assumptions on which the theoretical distribution function is based. The major discrepancy is that the theory applies only to a group of tracer particles having identical transport character istics, whereas the tracer particles did not all have the same characteristics. In addition to defining the dispersion of particles, the observed distribution curves provided information for computing the bed material discharge. The computation of discharge was made with a continuity-type equation, which states simply that the discharge is the product of the mean velocity of the particles and the cross-sectional area through which they move. Although a direct comparison of the computed discharge and a measured discharge could not be made, the computed discharge compared favorably with the discharge computed by the modified Einstein procedure. Although the concentration-distribution function was derived for the initial conditions of a vertical-plane source, it can be extended to more complex conditions by performing appropriate mathematical operations. In addition, the function can be applied to real situations if the constants in the concentration distribution function and the depth of the zone of particle movement in the bed are known. When the bed configuration consists of dunes or ripples, the depth of the zone of particle movement can be estimated from longitudinal profiles of the bed surface. However, until the relations between hydraulic and sediment parameters and the constants in the theoretical dis tribution function are defined, the constants can be evaluated only by experiment.},

abstract = {A model of sand transport in water is produced by combining a turbulence-resolving large eddy simulation (LES) with a discrete element model (DEM) prescribing the motion of individual grains of medium sand. The momentum effect of each particle on the fluid is calculated at the LES cell containing the particle, and the fluid velocity and pressure, interpolated to each particle center, is used to derive fluid force on each particle in the DEM. Eleven numerical experiments are conducted of an initially flat bed of particles. The experiments span a range of motion, from essentially no motion to vigorous suspension. Hydraulic roughness is found to increase abruptly at the transition from bed load to suspended load transport. Suspended sediment extracts momentum from the flow and decreases the rate of shear. Whereas, slightly higher in the flow, vertical drag by suspended grains damps turbulence and increases the rate of shear. Vertical sediment diffusivity and effective particle settling velocity are much smaller than is commonly assumed in suspended sediment models. The bed load experiments suggest that saltation by itself is a poor model of bed load sand transport. In contrast to expectations from saltation models, the peak bed load flux occurs at essentially the same level as the bed, and grains move slowly in frequent contact with other grains. Higher- and faster-moving bed load grains that can be considered to be in saltation represent a smaller portion of the total flux. Entrainment of bed load grains occurs in response to fluid penetration of the bed by high-vorticity turbulence structures embedded within broader high speed fluid regions referred to as a sweeps or high-speed wedges.},

abstract = {Despite several decades of investigations, accounting for the effect of the wide range of grain sizes composing the bed of rivers on bedload transport remains a challenging problem. We investigate this problem by studying experimentally the influence of grain size distribution on bedload transport in the simple configuration of a bimodal sediment bed composed of a mixture of 2 populations of quartz grains of sizes D-1 = 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm and D-2 = 2.2 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. The experiments are carried out in a tilted rectangular flume inside which the sediment bed is sheared by a steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we focus on the measurement of the average particle velocity and the surface density of moving particles, defined as the number of moving particles per unit surface of the bed. These two quantities are measured separately for each population of grains as a function of the dimensionless shear stress (or Shields number) and the fraction of the bed surface covered with small grains. We show that the average velocity and the surface density of moving particles obey the same equations as those reported by Lajeunesse et al. (2010) for a bed of homogeneous grain size. Once in motion, the grains follow therefore similar laws whether the bed is made of uniform sediment or of a bimodal mixture. This suggests that the erosion-deposition model established by Lajeunesse et al. (2010) for a bed of uniform sediment can be generalized to the case of a bimodal one. The only difference evidenced by our experiments concerns the critical Shields number for incipient sediment motion. Above a uniform sediment bed, the latter depends on the particle Reynolds number through the Shields curve. In the case of a bimodal bed, our experiments show that the critical Shields numbers of both populations of grains decrease linearly with the fraction of the bed surface covered with small grains. We propose a simple model to account for this observation.},

abstract = {An experimental study of lift force on a spherical sediment particle at different exposures was conducted in a laboratory flume. It is found that the functional form of the theoretical probability density function (pdf) of lift force similar to that of drag force is inadequate. An improved expression for the pdf based on the normal error law is provided which matches the measured data up to ±3 times the standard deviation of lift force for all exposures. The skewness of the measured lift force is found to increase with increase in exposure. In addition, the kurtosis of the measured lift force is found to be higher than that for a normal distribution for all exposures, resulting in higher probability of occurrence of extreme events (beyond ±3 times standard deviation). A spectral density function of lift force as a function of streamwise and stream-normal velocity is developed and validated using the measured lift force data. The spectrum predicted by the proposed model closely follows the measured spectrum for exposures 7.5 mm and 10 mm while it over predicts at frequencies below 1 Hz for exposures 0 mm and 2.5 mm because of poor coherence between lift force and streamwise velocity. The time history plots of measured lift at lower exposures showed that the high-frequency positive and negative fluctuations of lift correspond to strongly positive streamwise velocity fluctuations, a phenomenon not captured by the predictive model. Predominance of fluctuating Bernoulli's lift over lift due to stream-normal velocity fluctuations is observed at all exposures, more so in the case of lower exposures.},

abstract = {Frequently, an assessment of the mean water velocity in a stream is necessary to estimate the discharge associated with a particular flow depth or, conversely, the mean depth associated with a particular discharge. In the absence of a direct measurement of flow velocity, a flow resistance approach, which establishes the relation between depth and velocity, can be applied. Two approaches have been used in the past: traditional approaches based on the use of a resistance coefficient (e.g., Darcy-Weisbach) or dimensionless hydraulic geometry approaches. To examine if one approach is more appropriate for steep streams, data from 31 flume experiments conducted to examine flow resistance in self-formed cascade channels were analyzed. A dimensionless hydraulic geometry approach developed using at-a-station data to characterize the q* exponent and between-site data to characterize the exponent on the channel slope term was more accurate than more traditional approaches. The developed relation was similar to the established rational relation (v {\&}{\#}945; g0.2q0.6s{\&}{\#}8722;0.4S0.2), suggesting that the rational relation has merit. The approach does not utilize a flow partitioning approach since, in steep streams with small relative depths, the grains themselves generate form and spill resistance. The observation that a single dimensionless hydraulic geometry flow resistance relation can describe measurements across a range of grain sizes and bed slopes (3{\&}{\#}8211;21{\%}) suggests that steep streams may follow a single scaling relation similar to the regime equations associated with lowland rivers.},

To study the equilibrium conditions in a channel following different episodic sediment supply regimes (defined by grain size distribution, frequency, and magnitude of events), we simulate sediment transport through an idealized reach with our numerical 1-D model “BESMo” (Bedload Scenario Model). The model performs well in replicating flume experiments of a similar scope (where sediment was fed constantly, in one, two, or four pulses) and allowed the exploration of alternative event sequences. We show that in these experiments, the order of events is not important in the long term, as the channel quickly recovers even from high magnitude events. In longer equilibrium simulations, we imposed different supply regimes on a channel, which after some time leads to an adjustment of slope, grain size, and sediment transport that is in equilibrium with the respective forcing conditions. We observe two modes of channel adjustment to episodic sediment supply. (1) High-frequency supply regimes lead to equilibrium slopes and armouring ratios that are like conditions in constant-feed simulations. In these cases, the period between pulses is shorter than a “fluvial evacuation time”, which we approximate as the time it takes to export a pulse of sediment under average transport conditions. (2) In low-frequency regimes the pulse period (i.e., recurrence interval) exceeds the “fluvial evacuation time”, leading to higher armouring ratios due to the longer exposure of the bed surface to flow. If the grain size distribution of the bed is fine and armouring weak, the model predicts a decrease in the average channel slope. The ratio between the “fluvial evacuation time” and the pulse period constitutes a threshold that can help to quantify how a system responds to episodic disturbances.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Stable reticulate structures, which we call “stone cells,” have been observed in cobble-gravel channel beds with low bed material transport rates. Experiments show that such structures develop simultaneously with the armor layer during an extended period when flows do not exceed the Shields threshold by more than ∼2 times, so that bed material transport is low. They are constructed by particles moving from less stable positions into more stable configurations against each other. Intermediate developments include clusters and stone lines. They reduce sediment transport by orders of magnitude and are evidently a major stability-promoting mechanism in gravel channels. The timescale for their development suggests that the boundaries of many gravel-bed channels are not in equilibrium with recent competent flows but reflect the history of recent “dominant” flows.},

abstract = {A series of flume experiments were conducted to study the effect of bed form dynamics on the flow over a gravel bed comprising a wide distribution of grain sizes. Instantaneous high-frequency streamwise flow velocities were sampled using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter at a frequency of 200 Hz, while the simultaneous bed elevations were sampled using sonar transducers at a frequency of 0.2 Hz for a duration of 20 h. Spectral analysis of the measured velocity fluctuations reveals the existence of two distinct power law scaling regimes. At high frequencies, an inertial subrange of turbulence with {\&}{\#}8764;{\&}{\#}8722;5/3 Kolmogorov scaling is observed. At low frequencies, another scaling regime with spectral slope of about {\&}{\#}8722;1.1 is found. We interpret this range as the signature of the evolving multiscale bed topography on the near-bed velocity fluctuations. The two scaling ranges are separated by a spectral gap, i.e., a range of intermediate scales with no additional energy contribution. The high-frequency limit of the spectral gap corresponds to the integral scale of turbulence. The low-frequency end of the gap corresponds to the scale of the smallest bed forms identified by the velocity sensor, which depends on the position of the sensor. Our results also show that the temporal scales of the largest bed forms can be potentially identified from spectral analysis of low-resolution velocity measurements collected near the channel bed.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In cloud modeling studies, the time evolution of droplet size distributions due to collision-coalescence events is usually modeled with the kinetic collection equation (KCE) or Smoluchowski coagulation equation. However, the KCE is a deterministic equation with no stochastic fluctuations or correlations. Therefore, the full stochastic description of cloud droplet growth in a coalescing system must be obtained from the solution of the multivariate master equation, which models the evolution of the state vector for the number of droplets of a given mass. Unfortunately, due to its complexity, only limited results were obtained for certain type of kernels and monodisperse initial conditions. In this work, a novel numerical algorithm for the solution of the multivariate master equation for stochastic coalescence that works for any type of kernels, multivariate initial conditions and small system sizes is introduced. The performance of the method was checked by comparing the numerically calculated particle mass spectrum with analytical solutions of the master equation obtained for the constant and sum kernels. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the turbulent hydrodynamic kernel, and true stochastic averages were compared with numerical solutions of the kinetic collection equation for that case. The results for collection kernels depending on droplet mass demonstrates that the magnitude of correlations are significant, and must be taken into account when modeling the evolution of a finite volume coalescing system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Wolman1960,
abstract = {The relative importance in geomorphic processes of extreme or catastrophic events and more frequent events of smaller magnitude can be measured in terms of (1) the relative amounts of "work" done on the landscape and (2) in terms of the formation of specific features of the landscape. For many processes, above the level of competence, the rate of movement of material can be expressed as a power function of some stress, as for example, shear stress. Because the frequency distributions of the magnitudes of many natural events, such as floods, rainfall, and wind speeds, approximate log-normal distributions, the product of frequency and rate, a measure of the work performed by events having different frequencies and magnitudes will attain a maximum. The frequency at which this maximum occurs provides a measure of the level at which the largest portion of the total work is accomplished. Analysis of records of sediment transported by rivers indicates that the largest portion of the total load is carried by flows which occur on the average once or twice each year. As the variability of the flow increases and hence as the size of the drainage basin decreases, a larger percentage of the total load is carried by less frequent flows. In many basins 90 per cent of the sediment is removed by storm discharges which recur at least once every five years. Transport of sand and dust by wind in general follows the same laws. The extreme velocities associated with infrequent events are compensated for by their rarity, and it is found that the greatest bulk of sediment is transported by more moderate events. Many rivers are competent to erode both bed and banks during moderate flows. Observations of natural channels suggest that the channel shape as well as the dimensions of meandering rivers appear to be associated with flows at or near the bankfull stage. The fact that the bankfull stage recurs on the average once every year or two years indicates that these features of many alluvial rivers are controlled by these more frequent flows rather than by the rarer events of catastrophic magnitude. Because the equilibrium form of wind-blown dunes and of wave-formed beaches is quite unstable, the frequency of the events responsible for their form is less clearly definable. However, dune form and orientation are determined by both wind velocity and frequency. Similarly, a hypothetical example suggests that beach slope oscillates about a mean value related in part to wave characteristics generated by winds of moderate speed. Where stresses generated by frequent events are incompetent to transport available materials, less frequent ones of greater magnitude are obviously required. Closer observation of many geomorphic processes is required before the relative importance of different processes and of events of differing magnitude and frequency in the formation of given features of the landscape can be adequately evaluated.},

abstract = {To clarify the grain-scale mechanisms that control the onset and cessation of sediment transport, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of granular beds driven by a model hydrodynamic shear flow. We find a critical value for the Shields number (the nondimensional shear stress at the top of the granular bed) that separates flowing and static states, with a bed flow rate that is discontinuous at the critical value. The transition times between flowing and static states diverge as the system approaches the critical Shields number from above and below. Additionally we find that, for finite systems, the onset of flow occurs stochastically at supercritical Shields numbers. We show that the statistics of the Shields number at failure obey Weibullian weakest-link statistics, and that the onset of flow is caused by local grain rearrangements that give rise to additional rearrangements and then to continuous flow. Thus, the onset of motion is governed by the packing structure of the granular bed, even deep beneath the surface. Since the fluid dynamics is strongly coupled to the settling process and thus to the bed structure, this also suggests a strong feedback between the fluid dynamics and granular physics in bed mobilization.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding large wood (LW, ≥ 1 m long and ≥ 10 cm in diameter) dynamics in rivers is critical for many disciplines including those assessing flood hazard and risk. However, our understanding of wood entrainment and deposition is still limited, mainly because of the lack of long‐term monitoring of wood related processes. The dataset presented here was obtained from more than 8 years of monitoring of 1264‐tagged wood pieces placed in four low‐order streams of the Chilean mountain ranges, and is used to further our understanding of key factors controlling LW dynamics. We show that LW displacement lengths were longer during periods when peak‐flow water depths (Hmax) exceeded the bankfull stage (HBk) than in periods with Hmax ≤ HBk, and that these differences were significantly higher for smaller wood pieces. LW length and length relative to channel dimensions were the main factors governing LW entrainment; LW displacement lengths were inversely related to the ratio of piece length to H15{\%} (i.e. the level above which the flow remains for 15{\%} of the time) and to the ratio of H15{\%} to bankfull width. Unrooted logs and LW pieces located at the bankfull stage travelled significantly longer distances than logs with attached rootwads and those located in other positions within the bankfull channel. A few large logjams were broken during the period of observation, and in all occasions, LW from these broken logjams did not travel over longer distances than other pieces of LW moved in the same periods and in the same stream segments. Most importantly, our work reveals that LW dynamics tend to be concentrated within a few reaches in each stream and that reaches exhibiting high wood dynamics (extensive entrainment, deposition or repositioning of LW) are significantly wider and less steep than less dynamic reaches.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation into the fluctuating pressure acting on sediment particles on the bed of an open-channel flow was carried out in a large laboratory flume for a range of flow depths and bed slopes. The pressure measurements were made using 23 spherical particles instrumented with differential pressure sensors. These measurements were complemented with simultaneous measurements of the velocity field using high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The pressure statistics show that the standard deviations of the drag and lift fluctuations vary from 2.0 to 2.6 and from 2.5 to 3.4 times the wall shear stress, respectively, and are dependent on relative submergence and flow Reynolds number. The skewness is positive for the drag fluctuations and negative for the lift fluctuations. The kurtosis values of both drag and lift fluctuations increase with particle submergence. The two-particle correlation between drag and lift fluctuations is found to be relatively weak compared to the two-point drag–drag and lift–lift correlations. The pressure cross-correlations between particles separated in the longitudinal direction exhibit maxima at certain time delays corresponding to the convection velocities varying from 0.64 to 0.72 times the bulk flow velocity, being very close to the near-bed eddy convection velocities. The temporal autocorrelation of drag fluctuations decays much faster than that for the lift fluctuations; as a result, the temporal scales of lift fluctuations are 3–6 times that of drag fluctuations. The spatial and temporal scales of both drag and lift fluctuations show dependence on flow depth and bed slope. The spectral behaviour of both drag and lift fluctuations is also assessed.

The dynamics of packet formation and the ramifications of organization of coherent structures (hairpins or packets) into larger-scale structures are discussed. Evidence for a large-scale mechanism in the outer layer suggests that further organization of packets may occur on scales equal to and larger than the boundary layer thickness.},

Tracer trajectories are dominated by periods of immobility (“waiting times”) as they are buried and reexcavated in the stochastically evolving river bed. Here we model bed evolution as a random walk with mean-reverting tendency (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) originating from the restoring effect of erosion and deposition. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model contains two parameters, a and b, related to the particle feed rate and range of bed elevation fluctuations, respectively. Observations of bed evolution in flume experiments agree with model predictions; in particular, the model reproduces the asymptotic t−1 tail in the tracer waiting time exceedance probability distribution. This waiting time distribution is similar to that inferred for tracers in natural gravel streams and avalanching rice piles, indicating applicability of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting model to many disordered transport systems with tracer burial and excavation. 1.},

abstract = {Riparian vegetation can significantly influence the morphology of a river, affecting channel geometry and flow dynamics. To examine the effects of riparian vegetation on gravel bed braided streams, we conducted a series of physical experiments at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory with varying densities of bar and bank vegetation. Water discharge, sediment discharge, and grain size were held constant between runs. For each run, we allowed a braided system to develop, then seeded the flume with alfalfa (Medicago sativa), allowed the seeds to grow, and then continued the run. We collected data on water depth, surface velocity, and bed elevation throughout each run using image- based techniques designed to collect data over a large spatial area with minimal disturbance to the flow. Our results show that the influence of vegetation on overall river patterns varied systematically with the spatial density of plant stems. Vegetation reduced the number of active channels and increased bank stability, leading to lower lateral migration rates, narrower and deeper channels, and increased channel relief. These effects increased with vegetation density. Vegetation influenced flow dynamics, increasing the variance of flow direction in vegetated runs and increasing scour depths through strong downwelling where the flow collided with relatively resistant banks. This oblique bank collision also provides a new mechanism for producing secondary flows. We found it to be more important than the classical curvature-driven mechanism in vegetated runs.},

The locations of effective drag and lift forces are explored, as well as the ratio of drag and lift coefficients. The comparison between rollover and pickup probability models indicates that pickup model is valid for cases of critical shear stress less than 0.1 while rollover model works for critical shear stress larger than 0.1.

abstract = {Characterizing the collective behavior of particle transport on the Earth surface is a key ingredient in describing landscape evolution. We seek equations that capture essential features of transport of an ensemble of particles on hillslopes, valleys, river channels, or river networks, such as mass conservation, superdiffusive spreading in flow fields with large velocity variation, or retardation due to particle trapping. Development of stochastic partial differential equations such as the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) begins with assumptions about the random behavior of a single particle: possible velocities it may experience in a flow field and the length of time it may be immobilized. When assumptions underlying the ADE are relaxed, a fractional ADE (fADE) can arise, with a non-integer-order derivative on time or space terms. Fractional ADEs are nonlocal; they describe transport affected by hydraulic conditions at a distance. Space fractional ADEs arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow field over the entire system. Time fractional ADEs arise as a result of power law particle residence time distributions and describe particle motion with memory in time. Here we present a phenomenological discussion of how particle transport behavior may be parsimoniously described by a fADE, consistent with evidence of superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior in natural and experimental systems.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of duration, in addition to magnitude, of energetic turbulent events on particle dislodgement under threshold of motion conditions. It is therefore proposed here that the use of turbulence sequences, instead of single instantaneous extreme events, is more appropriate for characterizing the role of fluctuating velocities and associated hydrodynamic forces on particle mobility. The validity of the proposed method is examined through the detailed analysis of directly measured velocity and pressure data sets. In an effort to relate the results of the conventional velocity quadrant analysis with the instantaneous pressure measurements, the concept of pressure quadrant analysis is introduced. The coupled sequences of the synchronous velocity and pressure quadrant events allow for a more complete description of the local turbulent flow characteristics, including the prevalent coherent structures, and more clear interpretation of their role on particle mobility. It is concluded here that large-scale sweep structures are capable of generating excessive and persistent force fluctuations which are predominantly responsible for the dynamic process of particle dislodgement. This result supports the impulse criterion as the proper way of accounting for the cumulative effect of coherent structures on particle movement.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic modification of forests has often decoupled streams from riparian ecosystems and altered natural wood recruitment processes. Extensive research has shown that large wood significantly impacts channel dynamics, especially in small and intermediate sized forested streams where wood pieces are similar in length to channel width, and many stream rehabilitation efforts now involve the addition of large wood to streams. The primary objective of this research is to investigate the relation between large wood and reach scale channel morphology and hydraulics using a physical model, in order to better inform stream rehabilitation programs and future modeling efforts. Four experiments, each comprising numerous five hour runs, were conducted using a Froude-scaled stream table with wood loads scaled to 0m3/m2, 0.011m3/m2, 0.016m3/m2, and 0.022m3/m2. The addition of large wood significantly decreased the reach-averaged velocity in all experiments, and was associated with decreased sediment transport and increased sediment storage in the reach. Increases in bed and water surface slope compensated for the loss of energy available to transport sediment, and enabled the system to reach a new steady state within the equivalent of 6 to 9years. Adding wood increased pool frequency, as well as the variability in cross-sectional depth, while causing the reach to undergo a transition from a plane-bed to a riffle-pool morphology. Retention of fine sediment increased the availability of fish spawning substrate, while increased water stage improved connectivity between the channel and the floodplain. The changes in habitat complexity were generally related to the wood load added to the reach, but were also dependent on the orientation and arrangement of the pieces. These results demonstrate that wood may exert a primary control on channel morphodynamics and the availability of aquatic habitat in intermediate sized streams, and suggest that the benefits from stream rehabilitation efforts are highly dependent on project scale. The relatively long time needed to realize habitat benefits demonstrates that long term monitoring of rehabilitation projects is necessary. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The paper presents the detailed formulation and validation results of simple and robust procedures for the generation of synthetic turbulence aimed at providing artificial turbulent content at the RANS-to-LES interface within a zonal Wall Modelled LES of attached and mildly separated wall-bounded flows. There are two versions of the proce- dure. The aerodynamic version amounts to a minor modification of a synthetic turbulence generator developed by the authors previously, but the acoustically adapted version is new and includes an internal damping layer, where the pressure field is computed by “weight- ing” of the instantaneous pressure fields from LES and RANS. This is motivated by the need to avoid creating spurious noise as part of the turbulence generation. In terms of pure aerodynamics, the validation includes canonical shear flows (developed channel flow, zero pressure gradient boundary layer, and plane mixing layer), as well as a more complex flow over the wall-mounted hump with non-fixed separation and reattachment, with emphasis on a rapid conversion from modeled to resolved Reynolds stresses. The aeroacoustic applica- tions include the flow past a trailing edge and over a two-element airfoil configuration. In all cases the methodology ensures a very acceptable accuracy for the mean flow, turbulent statistics and, also, the near- and far-field noise. Keywords},

abstract = {In this work, a fully-coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and Discrete Element Method (DEM) are used to simulate a unidirectional turbulent open-channel flow over the full range of sediment transport regimes. The fluid and particles are computed on separate grids using a dual-grid formulation to maintain consistency and avoid instability issues. The results of coupling the dispersed phase to a multiphase flow solver that uses volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are compared to those obtained from coupling through drag to a single flow solver. The current work also examines the applicability and limitations of lumping particles as a representative particle to reduce the cost of simulations. Insight to the impact of different turbulent events to the entrainment of particles is also given. The simulation results of sediment transport from both coupling techniques show good agreement with empirical formulas in the bedload regime, but under-predict sediment transport in the suspended load regime. In the suspended load regime, using partial coupling, the rate of sediment transport was found to be under-predicted as compared to full-coupling. The deviation in results in the suspended load regime was found to increase with increases in the applied shear stress. Both coupling methods revealed the same effect on the friction factor where friction increases in the bedload regime and decreases in the suspended load regime reaching a maximum at the transition between regimes. This result is contrary to past studies which have shown a discrete jump in the friction factor at the transition. Lumping particles as representative particles is shown to reduce the simulation cost by more than a factor of 5 when using a scaling factor of 2. By doing a quadrant analysis on information obtained from particle and flow field results, it was found that most of the particles are entrained by more frequent sweep events.},

abstract = {Bagnold developed his formula for bedload transport over several decades, with the final form of the relation given in his 1980 paper. In this formula, bedload transport rate is a function of stream power above some threshold value, depth and grain size. In 1986, he presented a graph which illustrated the strength of his relation. A double-log graph of bedload transport rate, adjusted for depth and grain size, versus excess stream power was shown to collapse along a line having a slope of 15. However, Bagnold based his analyses on limited data. In this paper, the formula is re-examined using a large data set in order to define the most consistent empirical representation, and dimensional analysis is performed to seek a rationalization of the formula.Functional analysis is performed for the final version of the equation defined by Bagnold to determine if the slope of 15 is preserved and to assess the strength of the relation. Finally, relations between excess stream power and bedload transport are examined for a fixed slope of 15 to assess the performance of various depth and grain size adjustment factors. The rational scaling is found to provide the best result. Copyright 2000 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018. American Geophysical Union. Sediment particles transported as bed load undergo alternating periods of motion and rest, particularly at weak flow intensity. Bed load transport can be investigated by either following the motion of individual particles (Lagrangian approach) or observing the phenomenon at prescribed locations (Eulerian approach). In this paper, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions are merged into a unifying framework that includes definitions for quantities used to describe the kinematics of particle motion, as well as the relationships among these quantities. The alternation of motion and rest is represented by two complementary descriptions: (i) proportion of motion, indicating either the relative time spent in motion by an individual particle or the relative number of moving particles; (ii) persistence of motion, indicating the extent to which the process consists of relatively few long periods of motion or of many short ones. The framework only involves first moments of the key quantities. The conceptual developments are tested against results from an experiment with weak bed load transport, demonstrating the soundness of the approach. From an operational point of view, a Lagrangian observation is difficult to perform, since the particle motion is usually investigated for finite spatial domains (e.g., a measurement window within a laboratory or natural reach). Strategies to overcome such limitations are described, suggesting the possibility of obtaining unbiased mean values for Lagrangian descriptors. The proposed framework can be used in any study aimed at parameterizing the kinematic properties of bed load particles as functions of the hydrodynamic conditions.},

Understanding the performance and limitations of the PIV method under these conditions is critical for optimising experimental parameters and robust interpretation of data. The optimum algorithm for extracting velocity fields from PIV images is the subject of ongoing revision with the goal of maximising resolution and minimising errors, and recent advances in this regard may be particularly beneficial for open-channel turbulence research. Key steps in the iterative discrete shift (IDS) and image deformation method (IDM) algorithms are detailed, and the fundamental differences between direct cross correlation and FFT-based correlation methods are explained. It is also shown how the resolution of an algorithm can be determined from its modulation transfer function (MTF), and how the MTF can be manipulated with the selection of intensity weighting windows.

abstract = {Sediment-laden flows are a complex solid-fluid interaction process. This study presents a multimode morphodynamic model system combined with shallow water theory and a nonequilibrium assumption for sediment transport. The model system aims to simulate the morphological change caused by sediment-laden flows with various sediment transport modes. It involves three modules: a hydrodynamic module, a sediment transport module, and a morphological evolution module. The hydrodynamic model is governed by modified shallow water equations considering the interaction effects of flow and sediment. A flexible sediment transport model is presented that incorporates a weight coefficient. The model can adaptively choose an appropriate transport mode according to local, real-time flow conditions. Bedload, suspended load, and total mixed sediment load are all involved. The model is solved by a second-order Godunov-type finite-volume method that is robust and accurate. Validation is demonstrated through a series of test cases. The results indicate that the model can attain good agreement with measured data, thereby demonstrating the capabilities of the multimode morphodynamic model system in predicting sediment-laden flows and resulting morphological change.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous materials abound in nature and man-made situations. Examples include porous media, biological materials, and composite materials. Diverse and interesting properties exhibited by these materials result from their complex microstructures, which also make it difficult to model the materials. Yeong and Torquato [Phys. Rev. E 57, 495 (1998)] introduced a stochastic optimization technique that enables one to generate realizations of heterogeneous materials from a prescribed set of correlation functions. In this first part of a series of two papers, we collect the known necessary conditions on the standard two-point correlation function S2(r) and formulate a conjecture. In particular, we argue that given a complete two-point correlation function space, S2(r) of any statistically homogeneous material can be expressed through a map on a selected set of bases of the function space. We provide examples of realizable two-point correlation functions and suggest a set of analytical basis functions. We also discuss an exact mathematical formulation of the (re)construction problem and prove that S2(r) cannot completely specify a two-phase heterogeneous material alone. Moreover, we devise an efficient and isotropy-preserving construction algorithm, namely, the lattice-point algorithm to generate realizations of materials from their two-point correlation functions based on the Yeong-Torquato technique. Subsequent analysis can be performed on the generated images to obtain desired macroscopic properties. These developments are integrated here into a general scheme that enables one to model and categorize heterogeneous materials via two-point correlation functions. We will mainly focus on basic principles in this paper. The algorithmic details and applications of the general scheme are given in the second part of this series of two papers.},

abstract = {Large wood (LW) recruitment, transport, and storage were evaluated over a century in Gregory and Riley creeks (Haida Gwaii, British Columbia) by modeling a reach-scale LW budget using two frameworks for output: LW loss through decay and downstream transport, and loss through depletion. At reach and at watershed scales, mass movement and bank erosion dominated inputs, and fluvial transport was an important flux term in several reaches. Large wood recruitment by mortality was relatively minor in comparison. Large proportions of the in-channel LW were stored in jams with a mean age of 40-50 years. Overall, both modeling approaches yielded reasonable stored LW predictions in the study creeks, with the omission/inclusion of transport responsible for the largest differences between models. Modeled storage generally was within 30{\%} of that measured in the field, and our results illustrate the large temporal variation in storage resulting from episodic inputs of LW from hillslopes.},

abstract = {The versatility of renewal theory is owed to its abstract formulation. Renewals can be interpreted as steps of a random walk, switching events in two-state models, domain crossings of a random motion, etc. We here discuss a renewal process in which successive events are separated by scale-free waiting time periods. Among other ubiquitous long time properties, this process exhibits aging: events counted initially in a time interval [0,t] statistically strongly differ from those observed at later times [t{\_}a,t{\_}a+t]. In complex, disordered media, processes with scale-free waiting times play a particularly prominent role. We set up a unified analytical foundation for such anomalous dynamics by discussing in detail the distribution of the aging renewal process. We analyze its half-discrete, half-continuous nature and study its aging time evolution. These results are readily used to discuss a scale-free anomalous diffusion process, the continuous time random walk. By this we not only shed light on the profound origins of its characteristic features, such as weak ergodicity breaking. Along the way, we also add an extended discussion on aging effects. In particular, we find that the aging behavior of time and ensemble averages is conceptually very distinct, but their time scaling is identical at high ages. Finally, we show how more complex motion models are readily constructed on the basis of aging renewal dynamics.},

abstract = {The fluvial riparian and aquatic patch mosaic varies along rivers according to geomorphological setting, hydrological regime, sediment supply and surface-groundwater connectivity. This relation between physical processes and plants is not unidirectional. Once established, riparian and aquatic plants frequently act as physical ecosystem engineers by trapping and stabilising sediments, organic matter and the propagules of other plant species, modifying the local sedimentary and morphological environment by driving the development of landforms and associated habitats, and so facilitating the rapid establishment of other plants that can in turn reinforce the development of landforms such as river banks, vegetated islands and floodplains. This paper reviews knowledge on the hydrogeomorphological significance of riparian and aquatic vegetation with a particular emphasis on humid temperate, mixed load, gravel bed, floodplain rivers.First, we investigate how vegetation dynamics across river margins are governed by hydrological processes that can both promote riparian vegetation growth and disturb and destroy riparian and aquatic vegetation. We show, with some simple numerical modeling, that different combinations of moisture supply and flow disturbance have the potential to generate many different responses in the lateral distribution of vegetation biomass along river corridors.Second, building on the varied lateral biomass distributions that are primarily dictated by hydrological processes, we review research evaluating characteristic vegetation-mediated landform development. We investigate aquatic and riparian plants acting as physical ecosystem engineers by creating and modifying habitats in river systems with sufficient suspended sediment supply for habitat or landform building. These plants have a crucial impact on sediment stabilisation and pioneer landform building along the interface between plant (resistance) dominated and fluvial-disturbance (force) dominated zones of the river corridor. We present some examples of vegetation-mediated landforms along rivers with strongly contrasting hydrological regimes and thus lateral distributions of vegetation.Lastly, we present a conceptual synthetic model that links the development of pioneer landforms by engineering plants with river morphology and morphodynamics in humid temperate, mixed load, gravel bed, floodplain rivers. Drawing on four example rivers, we show how different plants and pioneer landforms act at the interface between the plant dominated and fluvial-disturbance dominated zones of the river corridor as river energy and vegetation colonisation and growth change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The physical component of river channel (instream) habitat is of acknowledged significance, particularly in headwater streams; furthermore, physical habitats have been heavily impacted by human needs for river services: principally flood defence (channel modification) and water resources (flow regulation). Despite the control exercised on physical habitats by fluvial geomorphology (channel shape, bed material size, bedforms and bars) and flow regime (including the varying hydraulics of flow around these forms), their interaction has hitherto lacked a distinctive spatial formulation and biological validation.This article describes the challenges faced by a need (in both theoretical and practical areas) to understand the detail of physical habitat conditions in stream channels. A number of mesoscale approaches are emerging, both from ecology and geomorphology. We outline the field validation of a ‘habitat hydraulics' approach to the interaction between river discharge and channel form. Qualitative ‘flow types' are shown to be representative of discrete hydraulic conditions within mesoscale units of the channel bed described as ‘physical biotopes'. The approach is compared with parallel ecological research on ‘mesohabitats' and ‘functional habitats'. The extent, pattern and discharge-variability of physical biotopes can be surveyed in the field and used as a spatial guide to biological sampling (in this case for benthic invertebrates). Biological patterns (at the scale sampled here) appear to respond first to the river continuum concept's longitudinal zonation of the channel, but there is a marked secondary signal in statistical analyses from the pattern of biotopes.Given the promise of the physical biotope approach, its logical extension in predictive mode is via the hierarchical concepts shared by freshwater ecologists and geomorphologists; however, there is little agreement on scale terminology, hierarchical principles and, above all, a truly geo-morphological channel classification, based on reaches, into which mesoscale habitat typologies could be fed. Assuming a relationship between biological diversity and that of physical biotopes it should be the aim of river managers, whether intervening in the channel form or its flow regime, to optimize certain parameters of the pattern of biotopes; these parameters should be a focus for future research. Both the rapid survey and proper description of these patterns will benefit from the application of remote-sensing technology, improved instruments for microscale hydraulic studies and a GIS approach based upon the spatial principles of landscape ecology.},

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the results of an experimental study on the influence of an external turbulence field on the bed load sediment transport in an open channel. The external turbulence was generated by (1) a horizontal pipe placed halfway through the depth h; (2) a series of grids with a clearance of about one-third of the depth from the bed, and extending over a finite length of the flume; and (3) a series of grids with a clearance in the range (0.1-1.0) h from the bed, but extending over the entire length of the flume. Two kinds of experiments were conducted: plane-bed experiments and ripple-covered-bed experiments. In the former case, the flow in the presence of the turbulence generator was adjusted so that the mean bed shear stress was the same as in the case without the turbulence generator in order to single out the effect of the external turbulence on the sediment transport. In the ripple-covered-bed case, the mean and turbulence quantities of the streamwise component of the velocity were measured, and the Shields parameter, due to skin friction, was determined. The Shields parameter, together with the RMS value of the streamwise velocity fluctuations, was correlated with the sediment transport rate. The sediment transport increases markedly with increasing turbulence level.},

abstract = {Bedload transport generally depends on the bed shear stress and Reynolds number. Many studies conducted for the condition of turbulent flows have revealed the dependence of the transport rate on the bed shear stress, while knowledge of the Reynolds number effect on the transport rate is very limited. As an extreme case to reflect the viscous effect on sediment transport, sediment transport in laminar flows is considered in this paper. A stochastic approach is adopted to explore how the transport rate can be associated with characteristics of laminar flows. First, the probability of erosion in the absence of turbulence is assumed to depend only on the randomness of bed particles. The probability is then applied to formulate the sediment transport rate, of which the derivation is made largely based on Einstein's bedload theory.

abstract = {Discrete element modeling (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides an excellent platform to analyze fluid-particle systems. In all previous work, the fluid and particle systems are solved on a single grid. Contradictory requirements posed by resolution of fine scale fluid features such as turbulence, friction and heat transfer coefficient at immersed surfaces, and the resolution of important geometrical features, versus the necessity to maintain smoothness in particle solid fraction distribution on the chosen grid, often make single grid calculations untenable. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a novel two-grid technique in which a coarser particle grid is mapped on to a fine fluid grid. The technique uses suitable mappings to transfer fluid field variables from fluid-to-particle grid, and interphase transfer terms and void fractions from particle-to-fluid grid. The method is applied to a jetting fluidized bed of 750$\mu$m particles with a characteristic jet width of 1.6. mm. Results in the form of time-averaged void fractions and solid-velocity for two inlet jet velocities with single and multiple jets are compared to experiments. The results agree reasonably well with the experiments validating the two-grid approach for cases where single grid DEM-CFD would have been difficult to apply. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A series of flume experiments were conducted to study the effect of bed form dynamics on the flow over a gravel bed comprising a wide distribution of grain sizes. Instantaneous high-frequency streamwise flow velocities were sampled using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter at a frequency of 200 Hz, while the simultaneous bed elevations were sampled using sonar transducers at a frequency of 0.2 Hz for a duration of 20 h. Spectral analysis of the measured velocity fluctuations reveals the existence of two distinct power law scaling regimes. At high frequencies, an inertial subrange of turbulence with {\&}{\#}8764;{\&}{\#}8722;5/3 Kolmogorov scaling is observed. At low frequencies, another scaling regime with spectral slope of about {\&}{\#}8722;1.1 is found. We interpret this range as the signature of the evolving multiscale bed topography on the near-bed velocity fluctuations. The two scaling ranges are separated by a spectral gap, i.e., a range of intermediate scales with no additional energy contribution. The high-frequency limit of the spectral gap corresponds to the integral scale of turbulence. The low-frequency end of the gap corresponds to the scale of the smallest bed forms identified by the velocity sensor, which depends on the position of the sensor. Our results also show that the temporal scales of the largest bed forms can be potentially identified from spectral analysis of low-resolution velocity measurements collected near the channel bed.},

We present a self-contained review describing statistical models and methods that can be used to analyse patterns of points in space and time when the questions of scientific interest concern both their spatial and their temporal behaviour. We revisit moment characteristics that define summary statistics, as well as conditional intensities which uniquely characterise certain spatio-temporal point processes. We make use of these concepts to describe models and associated methods of inference for spatio-temporal point process data. Three new motivating real-data examples are described and analysed throughout the paper to illustrate the most relevant techniques, discussing the pros and cons of the different considered approaches.},

abstract = {Desert ephemeral gravel bed streams typically have bed surfaces that are relatively unarmored compared to the substrate below, while gravel bed streams in humid and snowmelt areas typically have well-armored surfaces. The degree of armoring can be characterized in terms of an armor ratio defined as the ratio of the surface median size to the substrate median size. A set of field data shows desert ephemeral gravel bed streams with armor ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 and with an average value of 1.2. The armor ratio of snowmelt-fed gravel bed streams in the same set ranges from 2 to 7, with an average value of 3.4. The reason for this difference is sought in terms of differing hydrological characteristics and sediment supply regimes. Thirteen experiments were conducted to study the formation of armoring under a range of hydrological conditions. The experiments have two limiting cases: a relatively flat hydrograph that represents conditions produced by continuous snowmelt and a sharply peaked hydrograph that represents conditions associated with flash floods. All constant hydrograph experiments developed a well-armored structured surface, while short asymmetrical hydrographs did not result in substantial vertical sorting. All symmetrical hydrographs show some degree of sorting, and the sorting tended to become more pronounced with longer duration. Sediment supply appears to be a first-order control on bed surface armoring, while the shape of the hydrograph plays a secondary role.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the two-dimensional rolling motion of a single large particle in a shallow water stream down a steep rough bed from both an experimental and a theoretical point of view. The experiment is prototypal of sediment transport on sloping beds. Two theoretical models are presented. The first model uses the mean kinetic energy balance to deduce the average particle velocity and the bounds of the flow-rate range within which a rolling regime occurs. This range is found to be narrow, which means that the fully rolling regime is a marginal mode of transport between repose and saltation. In the second model, the particle state (resting, rolling, saltating) is considered as a random variable, whose evolution constitutes a jump Markov chain. This makes it possible to deduce the mean particle velocity as a function of the flow conditions without explicit mention of its state. The theoretical results are finally compared to the experimental data. The second model provides correct estimates of the particle velocity and the probability of finding the particle in a given state for various flow conditions (bead material, slope, and roughness).},

@article{Pelosi2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2014 Author(s).Here we consider the 1-D morphodynamics of an erodible bed subject to bedload transport. Fluvial bed elevation variation is typically modeled by the Exner equation, which, in its classical form, expresses mass conservation in terms of the divergence of the bedload sediment flux. An entrainment form of the Exner equation can be written as an alternative description of the same bedload processes, by introducing the notions of an entrainment rate into bedload and of a particle step length, and assuming a certain probability distribution for the step length. This entrainment form implies some degree of nonlocality, which is absent from the standard flux form, so that these two expressions, which are different ways to look at same conservation principle (i.e., sediment continuity), may no longer become equivalent in cases when channel complexity and flow conditions allow for long particle saltation steps (including, but not limited to the case where particle step length has a heavy tailed distribution) or when the domain of interest is not long compared to the step length (e.g., laboratory scales, or saltation over relatively smooth surfaces). We perform a systematic analysis of the effects of the nonlocality in the entrainment form of the Exner equation on transient aggradational/degradational bed profiles by using the flux form as a benchmark. As expected, the two forms converge to the same results as the step length converges to zero, in which case nonlocality is negligible. As step length increases relative to domain length, the mode of aggradation changes from an upward-concave form to a rotational, and then eventually a downward-concave form. Corresponding behavior is found for the case of degradation. These results may explain anomalously flat, aggradational, long profiles that have been observed in some short laboratory flume experiments.},

@article{Gillespie1977,
abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the “reaction-rate equations”); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the “master equation”). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

Fluid forces such as drag, shear lift, Magnus lift, and lift due to centrifugal force are included in the derivation. The formulation of the lift force is theoretical. No empirical coefficient is used other than the drag coefficient C d , which is well established in the literature. In the low particle Reynolds number regime, where u * d/$\nu$ ≤ 1, the dimensionless stress required to initiate lifting is found to be much higher than that of rolling, the former substantially above the Shields' curve while the latter is substantially below it. The theory is compared with Vanoni's 1964 data, with meaningful results. For higher particle Reynolds number, where u * d /$\nu${\textgreater} 10, the dimensionless stress needed to initiate lifting is closer to that of rolling. The Shields' curve for the most part lies between the two theoretical thresholds.},

abstract = {This paper examines the importance of particle diffusion relative to advection in bedload transport. Particle diffusion is not included in existing approaches to bedload transport. Based on recent advances in the probabilistic theory of sediment transport, this paper emphasizes the part played by particle diffusion in bedload transport. The proposed model consists of the classic Saint-Venant–Exner equations supplemented by an advection–diffusion equation for particle activity (solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area). The model is solved numerically using standard finite-volume techniques. Our numerical simulations consider two case studies: (i) bed degradation under subcritical flow conditions and (ii) anti-dune development in supercritical flows on sloping gravel beds. These simulations show that particle diffusion plays a key role in bedload transport under non-uniform flow conditions. The diffusive sediment transport rate may be as large as the advective transport rate. When anti-dunes develop and migrate upstream, particle diffusion can create fluctuations in the sediment transport rate, whose amplitude compares with the capacity transport rate. Non-uniform flows can be characterized by a typical length, referred to as the adaptation length, which represents the distance that a particle dislodged from the bed travels before it reaches steady-state velocity. We show that the adaptation length is controlled by the particle advection velocity, particle diffusivity, and entrainment/deposition rates, but is independent of the bedform wavelength (contrary to common belief). For simulating bed degradation and anti-dune migration in gravel-bed rivers, a benchmark analysis of different bedload transport models provides evidence that those including particle diffusion perform better than classic models.},

abstract = {While the stabilizing function of large grains in step-pool streams has long been recognized, the role they play in gravel-bed streams is less clear. Most researchers have ignored the role of large grains in gravel bed streams, and have assumed that the median bed surface size controls the erodibility of alluvial boundaries. The experiments presented herein challenge this convention. Two experiments were conducted that demonstrate the significant morphodynamic implications of a slight change to the coarsetail of the bed material. The two distributions had the same range of particle sizes, and nearly identical bulk d50 values (1.6 mm), however the d90 of experiment GSD1 was slightly finer (3.7 mm) than that for experiment GSD2 (3.9 mm). Transport rates during GSD1 were nearly 4 times greater than during GSD2 (even though the dimensionless shear stress was slightly lower), and the channel developed a sinuous pattern with well developed riffles, pools and bars. During GSD2 the initial channel rectangular channel remained virtually unchanged for the duration of the experiment. The relative stability of GSD2 seems to be associated with a slightly larger proportion of stable (large) grains on the bed surface: at the beginning of GSD1, 3.5{\%} of the bed was immobile, while almost twice as much of it (6.1{\%}) was immobile at the beginning of GSD2. The results demonstrate that the largest grains (not the median size) exert first order control on channel stability.},

The image processing procedure is entirely presented. Experimental results, including the size, the position, the trajectory, the state of movement (rest, rolling, and saltation), and the neighborhood configuration of each bead, were compared with a previous one-size experiment. Analysis of the solid discharge along the vertical displayed only one peak of rolling in the two-size bed, whereas three peaks of rolling appeared in the one-size case due to a larger collective motion. The same contrast is evidenced in spatio-temporal diagrams where the two-size mixtures are characterized by the predominance of saltation and a smaller number of transitions between rest and rolling. The segregation of fine particles in a bed formed by larger particles was analyzed taking into account the neighborhood configurations.},

abstract = {Can we recover a signal f (element of) R{\^{}}N from a small number of linear measurements? A series of recent papers developed a collection of results showing that it is surprisingly possible to reconstruct certain types of signals accurately from limited measurements. In a nutshell, suppose that f is compressible in the sense that it is well-approximated by a linear combination of M vectors taken from a known basis Psi. Then not knowing anything in advance about the signal, f can (very nearly) be recovered from about M logN generic nonadaptive measurements only. The recovery procedure is concrete and consists in solving a simple convex optimization program. In this paper, we show that these ideas are of practical significance. Inspired by theoretical developments, we propose a series of practical recovery procedures and test them on a series of signals and images which are known to be well approximated in wavelet bases. We demonstrate empirically that it is possible to recover an object from about 3M–5M projections onto generically chosen vectors with the same accuracy as the ideal M-term wavelet approximation. We briefly discuss possible implications in the areas of data compression and medical imaging.},

abstract = {The physical component of river channel (instream) habitat is of acknowledged significance, particularly in headwater streams; furthermore, physical habitats have been heavily impacted by human needs for river services: principally flood defence (channel modification) and water resources (flow regulation). Despite the control exercised on physical habitats by fluvial geomorphology (channel shape, bed material size, bedforms and bars) and flow regime (including the varying hydraulics of flow around these forms), their interaction has hitherto lacked a distinctive spatial formulation and biological validation.This article describes the challenges faced by a need (in both theoretical and practical areas) to understand the detail of physical habitat conditions in stream channels. A number of mesoscale approaches are emerging, both from ecology and geomorphology. We outline the field validation of a ‘habitat hydraulics' approach to the interaction between river discharge and channel form. Qualitative ‘flow types' are shown to be representative of discrete hydraulic conditions within mesoscale units of the channel bed described as ‘physical biotopes'. The approach is compared with parallel ecological research on ‘mesohabitats' and ‘functional habitats'. The extent, pattern and discharge-variability of physical biotopes can be surveyed in the field and used as a spatial guide to biological sampling (in this case for benthic invertebrates). Biological patterns (at the scale sampled here) appear to respond first to the river continuum concept's longitudinal zonation of the channel, but there is a marked secondary signal in statistical analyses from the pattern of biotopes.Given the promise of the physical biotope approach, its logical extension in predictive mode is via the hierarchical concepts shared by freshwater ecologists and geomorphologists; however, there is little agreement on scale terminology, hierarchical principles and, above all, a truly geo-morphological channel classification, based on reaches, into which mesoscale habitat typologies could be fed. Assuming a relationship between biological diversity and that of physical biotopes it should be the aim of river managers, whether intervening in the channel form or its flow regime, to optimize certain parameters of the pattern of biotopes; these parameters should be a focus for future research. Both the rapid survey and proper description of these patterns will benefit from the application of remote-sensing technology, improved instruments for microscale hydraulic studies and a GIS approach based upon the spatial principles of landscape ecology.},

abstract = {In a series of flume experiments using constant discharge, flow depth, and gravel feed rate, sand feed rates were varied from 0.16 to 6.1 times that of gravel. The bed slope decreased with increasing sand supply, indicating that the gravel could be transported at the same rate, along with increasing amounts of sand, at smaller shear stresses. Prediction of river response to an increase in sediment supply requires prediction of mutual changes in bed composition and transport, and therefore a transport model defined in terms of the grain size of the bed surface. A recent model provides satisfactory prediction of the experimental observations and indicates the general response of gravel beds to increased sand supply. An increase in sand supply may increase the sand content of the river bed and the mobility of gravel fractions, which can lead to bed degradation and preferential evacuation of these sediments from the river.},

abstract = {A new criterion for the onset of entrainment of coarse sediment grains is presented here. It is hypothesized that not only the magnitude, but also the duration of energetic near bed turbulent events is relevant in predicting grain removal from the bed surface. It is therefore proposed that the product of force and its duration, or impulse, is a more appropriate and universal criterion for identifying conditions for particle dislodgement. This conjecture is investigated utilizing two theoretical models, representative of two modes of entrainment: saltation and rolling. In these models, instantaneous, highly fluctuating turbulent forces are simulated as short‐lived pulses of characteristic magnitude and duration, which transfer adequate fluid momentum to the particle, to trigger its entrainment. The analytical solution of the respective equations of motion is employed in deriving representations of threshold conditions in terms of the impulse characteristics. It is shown that hydrodynamic forces of sufficiently high magnitude are capable of entraining a particle only when they last long enough so that their impulse exceeds a critical value. To illustrate further the validity of the critical impulse concept, as well as extend and generalize its application to different entrainment levels of an individual grain, a novel experimental setup is utilized. This setup facilitates observations of angular displacement of a steel mobile particle in air due to electromagnetic pulses of different magnitude and duration. The experimentally obtained conditions for partial or complete entrainment support the concept of a critical impulse.},

@article{Dietrich1984,
abstract = {Bed load transport in Muddy Creek, Wyoming, a sand-bedded meandering river with equilibrium bottom topography, was found to consist of a zone of maximum sediment flux that shifted across the channel from near the inside bank in the upstream part of the bend toward the pool at the minimum radius of curvature. Significant net cross-stream transport continued even through the crossings between the bends. The downstream bed load transport field for the bend which was studied in greatest detail was the same as that computed from bed form migration measurements and can be predicted from appropriate boundary shear stress data and the Yalin bed load equation. The zone of maximum bed load transport followed an outward-shifting region of maximum boundary shear stress, although in the downstream end of the bend the sediment transport maximum tended to stay closer to the centerline than the boundary shear stress maximum due to particle size influences. Net cross-stream transport varied with particle size and was effected by three major processes: topographically-induced, near-bed, cross-stream flow; trough wise flow along obliquely oriented bed forms; and rolling or avalanching of particles on bed form lee faces plus rolling or mass sliding on a steep cross-stream point bar side slope. Coarse particles were carried outward over the top of the point bar by a near-bed cross-stream flow that was induced by downstream shoaling. These particles then rolled and slid on the point bar side slope and eventually were carried toward the outer bank by troughwise transport along oblique dunes. In the upstream part of the bend, fine particles were carried inward by the channel curvature-induced, near-bed flow and by troughwise transport along lee faces of oblique bed forms. Fine particles and coarse particles crossed paths on top of the point bar, where weak troughwise flow moved just the finer particles toward the convex bank, and on the point bar face, where coarse particles rolled against the secondary circu- lation that was carrying the finer particles. Net cross-stream bed load transport was toward the pool and was on average about 10{\%} of the downstream bed load transport. The Engelund equation predicts reasonably well the general pattern of net cross-stream transport through the meander, but it does not account for the substantial troughwise transport caused by oblique bedforms at several locations in the bend. Our observations suggest that equilibrium bed topography occurs when there is net outward transport into the outward shifting zone of maximum boundary shear stress.},

abstract = {A kinematic wave is a grouping cf moving objects in zones along a flow path and through which the objects pass. These concentrations may be characterized by a simple relation between the speed of the moving objects and their spacing as a result of interaction between them. Vehicular traffic has long been known to have such properties. Data are introduced to show that beads carried by flowing water in a narrow flume behave in an analogous way. The flux or trans- port of objects in a single lane of traffic is greatest when the objects are spaced about two diameters apart; beads in a single- lane flume as well as highway traffic conform to this property. By considering the sand in a pipe or flume to a depth affected by dune movement, it is shown that flux-concentration curves similar to the previously known cases can be constructed from experimental data. From the kinematic point of view, concen- tration of particles in dunes and other wave bed forms results when particles in transport become more numerous or closely spaced and interact to reduce the effectiveness of the ambient water to move them. Field observations over a 5-year period are reported in which individual rocks were painted for identification and placed at various spacings on the bed of ephemeral stream in New Mexico, to study the effect of storm flows on rock movement. The data on about 14,000 rocks so observed show the effect of variable spacing which is quantitatively as well as qualitatively com- parable to the spacing effect on small glass beads in a flume. Dunes and gravel bars may be considered kinematic waves caused by particle interaction, and certain of their properties can be related to the characteristics of the flux-concentration curve.},

abstract = {The paper presents the detailed formulation and validation results of simple and robust procedures for the generation of synthetic turbulence aimed at providing artificial turbulent content at the RANS-to-LES interface within a zonal Wall Modelled LES of attached and mildly separated wall-bounded flows. There are two versions of the proce- dure. The aerodynamic version amounts to a minor modification of a synthetic turbulence generator developed by the authors previously, but the acoustically adapted version is new and includes an internal damping layer, where the pressure field is computed by “weight- ing” of the instantaneous pressure fields from LES and RANS. This is motivated by the need to avoid creating spurious noise as part of the turbulence generation. In terms of pure aerodynamics, the validation includes canonical shear flows (developed channel flow, zero pressure gradient boundary layer, and plane mixing layer), as well as a more complex flow over the wall-mounted hump with non-fixed separation and reattachment, with emphasis on a rapid conversion from modeled to resolved Reynolds stresses. The aeroacoustic applica- tions include the flow past a trailing edge and over a two-element airfoil configuration. In all cases the methodology ensures a very acceptable accuracy for the mean flow, turbulent statistics and, also, the near- and far-field noise. Keywords},

About 100 researchers from about 20 different countries gathered in the hospitable centre of the University of Bologna to present the latest contributions in turbulence research. After an external peer review process the present 63 papers were collected for this forth issue on “progress in turbulence” dedicated to the mem- ory of Prof. Tim Nickels. Shortly after giving an invited lecture at the 4th ITI con- ference, the turbulence community lost a world-class scientist, a friend and devoted family man. Basic as well as applied research is driven by the rather notorious difficult and essentially unsolved problem of turbulence. In this collection of contributions clear progress can be seen in different aspects, ranging from new quality of numerical simulations to new concepts of experimental investigations and new theoretical de- velopments. The importance of turbulence is shown for a wide range of applications including: combustion, energy, flow control, urban flows, are few examples found in this volume. A motivation this year was to bring fundamentals of turbulence in connectionwith renewable energy. This lead us to add a special topic relevant to the impact of turbulence on the wind energy conversion. Beside all progress we have to realize that a general fundamental understanding of turbulence is still missing, even though new approaches are discovered and in- vestigated. These new approaches often lead to new methods, which result in being very useful for other disciplines. Thus turbulence research has been a source of new scientific fields over the last decades. Nonlinear dynamics, chaos research, fractals and complexity may be taken as examples. This span of research from pure mathematical analysis over turbulence physics to applied turbulence research has lead in the last decades to a broad diversification of turbulence research where contact between different sub-communities has some- times been lost. Itwas in particular the latter drifting apart in the community that has been the stimulation of the interdisciplinary turbulence initiative, which started in 1999 as cooperation between physicists and engineersworking in turbulence funded by the German science foundation DFG. Based on the successful previous confer- ences, we will continue with this initiative for subsequent years with the 5th ITI Conference planned for September 2012. The structure of the present book is as such that contributions have been bun- dled according to covering topics i.e. I Basic Turbulence Aspects, II Particle Laden Flows, III Modeling and Simulations, IV, Experimental Methods, V Special Flows, VI Atmospheric Boundary Layer, VII Boundary Layer, VIII Wind Energy and IX Convection. At this point we would like to thank all authors for their contributions to this proceedings and the referees giving critical comments to the contributions and there with considerably raising the scientific quality. We would like to thank Thomas Ditzinger from Springer for his patience during the production of the book. Finally we gratefully acknowledge the staff of the University of Bologna and Olga Kelbin, George Khujadze, Andreas Rosteck for helping us to carry out this conference.},

We observe subdiffusion over more than four orders of magnitude in time, clearly stretching into the sub-microsecond domain. The lipid motion delicately depends on the lipid chemistry, the lipid phase, and especially on the presence of cholesterol. We demonstrate that fractional Langevin equation motion universally describes the lipid motion in all phases including the gel phase, and in the presence of cholesterol. The results underline the relevance of anomalous diffusion in lipid bilayers and the strong effects of the membrane composition.},

abstract = {Sediment concentration distribution and the basic probability of sediment movement near the channel bed are two of the most important and fundamental issues in the study of sediments. Based on statistical analysis and considering the transport mechanisms, the rules of sediment concentration distribution near a channel bed are studied. Analytical expressions for the near-bed sediment concentration dis- tribution and mean sediment concentration are derived, and the expression for the mean sediment concentration near the bed is verified by measured data, which were obtained from previous experiments. With the help of statistical theory, the expressions of basic probabilities, i.e., rolling, saltating, and suspending probabilities, for sediment movement near the bed are also derived. The expression for starting prob- ability is verified by the measured data. The verification shows that the results from the proposed expression agree well with the measured data. This research has both theoretical and practical significance for further investigation concerning rules of bed load and suspended sedi- ment transport.},

abstract = {The concept of equal mobility of gravel transport is 2 decades old. The weak form of the hypothesis states that in order to transport the coarse half of the mean annual gravel load through a river reach at a rate equal to the fine half, the coarser material must be overrepresented on the bed surface, giving rise to a mobile-bed armor. The degree of mobile-bed armoring necessary to accomplish this diminishes with increasing bed shear stress. The strong form of the hypothesis states that the grain size distribution of the gravel portion of the bed load should be similar to that of the substrate and finer than that of the surface layer. Here the hypothesis is subjected to a rigorous test in the laboratory under controlled conditions which are nevertheless chosen to be as representative as possible of actual field conditions. The grain size distributions used in the experiment included both model “gravel” and model “sand.” At the end of the experiment the entire surface layer and a significant depth of substrate were removed from an entire reach of the channel and sieved. The results of the experiment confirmed the weak form of equal mobility: The surface layer was significantly coarsened compared with the bed load, even when the “sand” was excluded from the size distributions. The strong form of equal mobility was also supported by the experiment, in that the size distribution of the “gravel” substrate was nearly identical to the size distribution of the “gravel” portion of the load. The gravel substrate was, however, slightly but measurably coarser than the gravel load, a tendency that has been observed in the field in cases for which the strong form is not satisfied.},

abstract = {A fundamental component of stereo vision is that of epipolar geometry. It tells us that the corresponding point of a pixel in one image is restricted to a line in another image. This constraint reduces both the complexity of finding stereo correspondences and also the chance of making incorrect matches. When a refractive surface is introduced, which is in underwater imaging, this constraint no longer holds. Instead, the corresponding point of a pixel in one image is now restricted to a curve, not a line. In this paper we investigate the impact of a planar refractive interface has on underwater imaging and stereo matching. We address the issue of 3D point projection in a refractive medium, including cases where the refractive interface is not parallel with the camera's imaging plane. A novel method for calibrating the parameters of a planar refractive interface in the local image space is proposed. We show how to compute the refractive epipolar curve for a pixel, which allows us to generate a matching cost volume that compensates for the effects of refraction. Our experimental results show that our new approach can significantly improve the results of underwater stereo matching over previous approaches.},

abstract = {At the reach scale, a channel adjusts to sediment supply and flow through mutual interactions among channel form, bed particle size, and flow dynamics that govern river bed mobility. Sediment can impair the beneficial uses of a river, but the timescales for studying recovery following high sediment loading in the field setting make flume experiments appealing. We use a flume experiment, coupled with field measurements in a gravel-bed river, to explore sediment transport, storage, and mobility relations under various sediment supply conditions. Our flume experiment modeled adjustments of channel morphology, slope, and armoring in a gravel-bed channel. Under moderate sediment increases, channel bed elevation increased and sediment output increased, but channel planform remained similar to pre-feed conditions. During the following degradational cycle, most of the excess sediment was evacuated from the flume and the bed became armored. Under high sediment feed, channel bed elevation increased, the bed became smoother, mid-channel bars and bedload sheets formed, and water surface slope increased. Concurrently, output increased and became more poorly sorted. During the last degradational cycle, the channel became armored and channel incision ceased before all excess sediment was removed. Selective transport of finer material was evident throughout the aggradational cycles and became more pronounced during degradational cycles as the bed became armored. Our flume results of changes in bed elevation, sediment storage, channel morphology, and bed texture parallel those from field surveys of Redwood Creek, northern California, which has exhibited channel bed degradation for 30 years following a large aggradation event in the 1970s. The flume experiment suggested that channel recovery in terms of reestablishing a specific morphology may not occur, but the channel may return to a state of balancing sediment supply and transport capacity.},

abstract = {[1] Previous work highlights the need for data collection to identify appropriate models for temporal evolution of tracer dispersal in rivers. Results of 64 gravel-bed field tracer experiments covering a wide range of flow and sediment supply regimes are compiled here to determine the probabilistic character of gravel transport. We focus on whether particle travel distances and waits are thin-or heavy-tailed. While heavy-tailed travel distance distributions are observed between successive monitoring events in different hydrological and sediment supply regimes, heavy-tailedness does not persist through total travel distance over multiple monitoring events, suggesting that individual monitoring events occur before particle travel distance exceeds the characteristic correlation length for the channel (such that particles that start in fast paths remain in fast paths and particles in slow paths remain in slow paths). After a large number of transport events, super-diffusive spreading was not observed at any of the gravel bed streams. Continuous-time tracking of x, y, z coordinates of tracers in natural streams is necessary to capture exact step and waiting time distributions.},

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL datasets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin- sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI-SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.},

We find that nearly 80{\%} of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65{\%} of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

abstract = {The illumination of single population behaviour subject to the processes of birth, death and immigration has provided a basis for the discussion of the non-Gaussian statistical and temporal correlation properties of scattered radiation. As a first step towards the modelling of its spatial correlations, we consider the populations supported by an infinite chain of discrete sites, each subject to birth, death and immigration and coupled by migration between adjacent sites. To provide some motivation, and illustrate the techniques we will use, the migration process for a single particle on an infinite chain of sites is introduced and its diffusion dynamics derived. A certain continuum limit is identified and its properties studied via asymptotic analysis. This forms the basis of the multi-particle model of a coupled population subject to single site birth, death and immigration processes, in addition to inter-site migration. A discrete rate equation is formulated and its generating function dynamics derived. This facilitates derivation of the equations of motion for the first- and second-order cumulants, thus generalizing the earlier results of Bailey through the incorporation of immigration at each site. We present a novel matrix formalism operating in the time domain that enables solution of these equations yielding the mean occupancy and inter-site variances in the closed form. The results for the first two moments at a single time are used to derive expressions for the asymptotic time-delayed correlation functions, which relates to Glauber's analysis of an Ising model. The paper concludes with an analysis of the continuum limit of the birth–death–immigration–migration process in terms of a path integral formalism. The continuum rate equation and evolution equation for the generating function are developed, from which the evolution equation of the mean occupancy is derived, in this limit. Its solution is provided in closed form.},

abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments demonstrates that riparian vegetation can cause a braided channel to self-organize to, and maintain, a dynamic, single-thread channel. The initial condition for the experiments was steady-state braiding in non-cohesive sand under uniform discharge. From here, an experiment consisted of repeated cycles alternating a short duration high flow with a long duration low flow, and uniform dispersal of alfalfa seeds over the bed at the end of each high flow. Plants established on freshly deposited bars and areas of braidplain that were unoccupied during low flow. The presence of the plants had the effect of progressively focusing the high flow so that a single dominant channel developed. The single-thread channel self-adjusted to carry the high flow. Vegetation also slowed the rate of bank erosion. Matching of deposition along the point bar with erosion along the outer bend enabled the channel to develop sinuosity and migrate laterally while suppressing channel splitting and the creation of new channel width. The experimental channels spontaneously reproduced many of the mechanisms by which natural meandering channels migrate and maintain a single dominant channel, in particular bend growth and channel cutoff. In contrast with the braided system, where channel switching is a nearly continuous process, vegetation maintained a coherent channel until wholesale diversion of flow via cutoff and/or avulsion occurred, by which point the previous channel tended to be highly unfavorable for flow. Thus vegetation discouraged the coexistence of multiple channels. Varying discharge was key to allowing expression of feedbacks between the plants and the flow and promoting the transition from braiding to a single-thread channel that was then dynamically maintained.},

abstract = {Rifflepool sequences are maintained through the preferential entrainment of sediment grains from pools rather than riffles. This preferential entrainment has been attributed to a reversal in the magnitude of velocity and shear stress under high flows; however the Differential Sediment Entrainment Hypothesis (DSEH) postulates that differential entrainment can instead result from spatial sedimentological contrasts. Here we use a novel suite of in situ grain-scale field measurements from a rifflepool sequence to parameterize a physically-based model of grain entrainment. Field measurements include pivoting angles, lift forces and high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired using terrestrial laser scanning, from which particle exposure, protrusion and surface roughness were derived. The entrainment model results show that grains in pools have a lower critical entrainment shear stress than grains in either pool exits or riffles. This is because pool grains have looser packing, hence greater exposure and lower pivoting angles. Conversely, riffle and pool exit grains have denser packing, lower exposure and higher pivoting angles. A cohesive matrix further stabilizes pool exit grains. The resulting predictions of critical entrainment shear stress for grains in different subunits are compared with spatial patterns of bed shear stress derived from a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reach. The CFD model predicts that, under bankfull conditions, pools experience lower shear stresses than riffles and pool exits. However, the difference in sediment entrainment shear stress is sufficiently large that sediment in pools is still more likely to be entrained than sediment in pool exits or riffles, resulting in differential entrainment under bankfull flows. Significantly, this differential entrainment does not require a reversal in flow velocities or shear stress, suggesting that sedimentological contrasts alone may be sufficient for the maintenance of rifflepool sequences. This finding has implications for the prediction of sediment transport and the morphological evolution of gravel-bed rivers. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The emerging diffusive dynamics in many complex systems shows a characteristic crossover behaviour from anomalous to normal diffusion which is otherwise fitted by two independent power-laws. A prominent example for a subdiffusive-diffusive crossover are viscoelastic systems such as lipid bilayer membranes, while superdiffusive-diffusive crossovers occur in systems of actively moving biological cells. We here consider the general dynamics of a stochastic particle driven by so-called tempered fractional Gaussian noise, that is noise with Gaussian amplitude and power-law correlations, which are cut off at some mesoscopic time scale. Concretely we consider such noise with built-in exponential or power-law tempering, driving an overdamped Langevin equation (fractional Brownian motion) and fractional Langevin equation motion. We derive explicit expressions for the mean squared displacement and correlation functions, including different shapes of the crossover behaviour depending on the concrete tempering, and discuss the physical meaning of the tempering. In the case of power-law tempering we also find a crossover behaviour from faster to slower superdiffusion and slower to faster subdiffusion. As a direct application of our model we demonstrate that the obtained dynamics quantitatively described the subdiffusion-diffusion and subdiffusion-subdiffusion crossover in lipid bilayer systems. We also show that a model of tempered fractional Brownian motion recently proposed by Sabzikar and Meerschaert leads to physically very different behaviour with a seemingly paradoxical ballistic long time scaling.},

abstract = {An increasing number of natural phenomena do not fit into the relatively simple description of diffusion developed by Einstein a century ago  AS ALL of us are no doubt aware, this year has been declared "world year of physics" to celebrate the three remarkable breakthroughs made by Albert Einstein in 1905. However, it is not so well known that Einstein's work on Brownian motion – the random motion of tiny particles first observed and investigated by the botanist Robert Brown in 1827 – has been cited more times in the scientific literature than his more famous papers on special relativity and the quantum nature of light. In a series of publications that included his doctoral thesis, Einstein derived an equation for Brownian motion from microscopic principles – a feat that ultimately enabled Jean Perrin and others to prove the existence of atoms (see "Einstein's random walk" Physics World January pp19–22).   Einstein was not the only person thinking about this type of problem. The 27 July 1905 issue of Nature contained a letter with the title "The problem of the random walk" by the British statistician Karl Pearson, who was interested in the way that mosquitoes spread malaria, which he showed was described by the well-known diffusion equation. As such, the displacement of a mosquito from its initial position is proportional to the square root of time, and the distribution of the positions of many such "random walkers" starting from the same origin is Gaussian in form. The random walk has since turned out to be intimately linked to Einstein's work on Brownian motion, and has become a major tool for understanding diffusive processes in nature.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Temporally and spatially averaged models of bedload transport are inadequate to describe the highly variable nature of particle motion at low transport stages. The primary sources of this variability are the resisting forces to downstream motion resulting from the geometrical relation (pocket friction angle) of a bed grain to the grains that it rests upon, variability of the near-bed turbulent velocity field and the local modification of this velocity field by upstream, protruding grains. A model of bedload transport is presented that captures these sources of variability by directly integrating the equations of motion of each particle of a simulated mixed grain-size sediment bed. Experimental data from the velocity field downstream and below the tops of upstream, protruding grains are presented. From these data, an empirical relation for the velocity modification resulting from upstream grains is provided to the bedload model. The temporal variability of near-bed turbulence is provided by a measured near-bed time series of velocity over a gravel bed. The distribution of pocket friction angles results as a consequence of directly calculating the initiation and cessation of motion of each particle as a result of the combination of fluid forcing and interaction with other particles. Calculations of bedload flux in a uniform boundary and simulated pocket friction angles agree favourably with previous studies.},

abstract = {The pioneering predictor of fluvial bed-load transport rate proposed by Meyer-Peter and Moller in 1948 is still extensively used in basic research and engineering applications. A review of the basis for its formulation reveals, however, that an unnecessary bed roughness correction was applied to cases of plane-bed morphodynamic equilibrium. Its inclusion followed a flow resistance parameterization in tenus of the Nikuradse roughness height, which has been shown (well after the publication of their work) to be inappropriate for the characterization of mobile bed rough conditions in rivers. Removing the unnecessary correction and incorporating an improved correction of the boundary shear stress due to sidewall effects allow elucidation of the most parsimonious form of the bed-load relation of Meyer-Peter and Moller that is dictated by their own data set. The new predictor is presented in terms of two alternative power law forms. These amended forms show that, in the case of lower-regime plane-bed equilibrium transport of uniform bed sediment, the new estimates of volume bed-load transport rates are less than or equal to half the values that would be obtained with the original relation of Meyer-Peter and Moller in the absence of the unnecessary bed roughness correction. The meticulous database and clear analysis of the original work of Meyer-Peter and Moller greatly aided the present writers in their reanalysis, which liberally uses the hindsight offered by 58 years of subsequent research.},

abstract = {We report on bedload transport observations using piezoelectric bedload impact sensors (PBIS), an indirect method of estimating the volume of bedload transport of coarse sediment. The PBIS device registers vibrations produced by bedload (particle diameter {\textgreater}{\~{}}20 mm) and records the signal as a sum of the number of impulses per time. Sediment transport at the Erlenbach stream has been continuously monitored with a PBIS array starting in 1986. The sensor array spans the width of an entire cross-section and is mounted flush with the surface of a check dam immediately upstream of a sediment retention basin. We compare PBIS data with long-term sedimentation records obtained from repeated surveys of material stored in the sediment retention basin, with artificial sediment input under controlled conditions in the field, and also with laboratory experiments. The rate of bedload transport is proportional to the number of impacts on the sensor per unit time. The reliability of the calibration relationship increases with the length of the observation period, e.g. for higher numbers of impacts and larger bedload volumes. Sediment volumes for individual flood events estimated with the PBIS method are in agreement with volumes estimated using an independent empirical method based on the effective runoff volume of water, the peak water discharge, and the critical discharge for the onset of sediment trans- por},

In an effort to frame a more inclusive paradigm for river management, we discuss sediment inputs, transport, and storage within river systems; interactions among water, sediment, and valley context; and the need to broaden the natural flow regime concept. Explicitly incorporating sediment is challenging, because sediment is supplied, transported, and stored by nonlinear and episodic processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales than water and because sediment regimes have been highly altered by humans. Nevertheless, managing for a desired balance between sediment supply and transport capacity is not only tractable, given current geomorphic process knowledge, but also essential because of the importance of sediment regimes to aquatic and riparian ecosystems, the physical template of which depends on sediment-driven river structure and function.},

abstract = {1 It is a truism in geomorphology that climatic events operate on a landscape to drive sediment transport processes, yet few investigations have formally linked climate and terrain characteristics with geomorphological processes. In this study, we incorporate sediment transport equations derived from fieldwork into a computer model that predicts the delivery of sediment from hillslopes in a steep Mediterranean landscape near Santa Barbara, California. The sediment transport equations are driven by rainstorms and fires that are stochastically generated from probability distributions. The model is used to compare the rates and processes of sediment delivery under two vegetation types: coastal sage scrub and grasslands. Conversion of vegetation from sage to exotic grasses is a common land management strategy in the region and may also be engendered by regional climate change due to global warming. Results from the model suggest that (1) approximately 40{\%} more sediment is delivered from grasslands (98 t km(-2) yr(-1)) than the sage scrub (71 t km(-2) yr(-1)) and (2) chronic soil creep processes dominate under grasslands whereas catastrophic processes dominate under coastal sage scrub. Results from the model also suggest that changes in the spatial distribution of vegetation arising from climate change will have a greater effect on sediment delivery than changes in the magnitude and frequency of meteorological events.},

abstract = {Many rivers, lakes and other inland waters have been modified and degraded by human activities. Rehabilitation of degraded systems and mitigation of impacts of ongoing stresses are needed to preserve ecosystem services and fisheries, and are of a high priority if the aquatic biodiversity of inland waters is to be conserved. A number of technical solutions for rehabilitation and mitigation are available to restore habitat diversity, provide for environmental flows and ensure longitudinal and lateral connectivity within such ecosystems. It is recommended that such methods are applied on a basin-wide scale but is recognized that more restricted sections of waterbodies may have to be targeted. Planning for rehabilitation projects needs to be carefully conceived with a clear statement of the objectives of the rehabilitation and selection of the methods to be used. The selection of appropiate methods for any particular waterbody depends on local social and economic conditions and priorities. Land tenure, local laws and the interests of other local stakeholders in the resource also need to be incorporated into rehabilitation plans. In international rivers and lakes rehabilitation plans may need negotiation and cooperation by all riparian states. After execution, rehabilitation projects should be carefully monitored as to their success in meeting the objectives and modified should they fail to achieve the expected results.},

abstract = {The complex dynamics of partial bed-load transport in a series of well-controlled laboratory experiments are explored systematically and simulated by a stochastic model in this study. Flume experiments show that the leading front of bed-load on a 20-m-long, mixed-size gravel-bed moves anomalously, where the transient transport rate of the accelerating front varies with the observation time scale. In addition, observations show that moving particles may experience bimodal transport (i.e., coexistence of long trapping time and large jump length) related to bed coarsening and the formation of clusters on a heterogeneous gravel-bed, which is distinguished from the traditional theory of hiding-exposing interactions among mixed-size particles. A fractional derivative model is finally applied to characterize the overall behavior of partial bed-load transport, including the coexistence of the sub-diffusion and non-local feature caused by turbulence and the micro-relief within an armor layer.},

abstract = {A geomorphic transport law is a mathematical statement derived from a physical principle or mechanism, which expresses the mass flux or erosion caused by one or more processes in a manner that: 1) can be parameterized from field measurements, 2) can be tested in physical models, and 3) can be applied over geomorphically significant spatial and temporal scales. Such laws are a compromise between physics-based theory that requires extensive information about materials and their interactions, which may be hard to quantify across real landscapes, and rules-based approaches, which cannot be tested directly but only can be used in models to see if the model outcomes match some expected or observed state. We propose that landscape evolution modeling can be broadly categorized into detailed, apparent, statistical and essential realism models and it is the latter, concerned with explaining mechanistically the essential morphodynamic features of a landscape, in which geomorphic transport laws are most effectively applied. A limited number of studies have provided verification and parameterization of geomorphic transport laws for: linear slope-dependent transport, non-linear transport due to dilational disturbance of soil, soil production from bedrock, and river incision into bedrock. Field parameterized geomorphic transport laws, however, are lacking for many processes including landslides, debris flows, surface wash, and glacial scour. We propose the use of high- resolution topography, as initial conditions, in landscape evolution models and explore the applicability of locally parameterized geomorphic transport laws in explaining hillslope morphology in the Oregon Coast Range. This modeling reveals unexpected morphodynamics, suggesting that the use of real landscapes with geomorphic transport laws may provide new insights about the linkages between process and form.},

abstract = {This paper reviews sediment transport and channel morphology in small, forested streams in the Pacific Northwest region of North America to assess current knowledge of channel stability and morphology relevant to riparian management prac- tices around small streams. Small channels are defined as ones in which morphology and hydraulics may be significantly influenced by individual clasts or wood materials in the channel. Such chan- nels are headwater channels in close proximity to sediment sources, so they reflect a mix of hillslope and channel processes. Sediment inputs are derived directly from adjacent hillslopes and from the channel banks. Morphologically significant sediments move mainly as bed load, mainly at low intensity, and there is no standard method for measurement. The larger clastic and woody elements in the channel form persistent structures that trap significant vol- umes of sediment, reducing sediment transport in the short term and substantially increasing channel stability. The presence of such structures makes modeling of sediment flux in these channels – a potential substitute for measurement – difficult. Channel morphol- ogy is discussed, with some emphasis on wood related features. The problem of classifying small channels is reviewed, and it is recog- nized that useful classifications are purpose oriented. Reach scale and channel unit scale morphologies are categorized. A “distur- bance cascade” is introduced to focus attention on sediment trans- fers through the slope channel system and to identify management practices that affect sediment dynamics and consequent channel morphology. Gaps in knowledge, errors, and uncertainties have been identified for future research.},

abstract = {In this paper, the results of an experimental investigation of the turbulence intensity in gravel bed channels are described. The runs were carried out by measuring, with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, the turbulence intensity profile along six verticals of a given cross section in a laboratory flume. The analysis of the measured intensity distributions has shown the existence of two different regions, above and below the tops of the roughness elements, in which different intensity profiles occur. Furthermore, the measured profiles have shown a maximum of the turbulence intensity that decreases for increasing values of the roughness height, confirming that the turbulence damping efficiency increases when the roughness elements protrude inside the flow. The applicability of Nezu's relationship ?derived for a hydraulically smooth bed? for the experimental intensity profiles above the roughness elements is positively tested. Finally a new intensity distribution for a rough bed, applicable to the whole water depth, is proposed. In this profile, two coefficients having a known physical meaning ?the maximum turbulence intensity and the depth at which this maximum is located? appear.},

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

abstract = {Sediment transport rates in steep mountain channels are typically an order of magnitude lower than predicted by models developed for lowland rivers. One hypothesis for this observation is that particles are more stable in mountain channels due to particle-particle interlocking or bridging across the channel width. This hypothesis has yet to be tested, however, because we lack direct measurements of particle friction angles in steep mountain channels. Here we address this data gap by directly measuring the minimum force required to dislodge sediment (pebbles to boulders) and the sediment weight in mountain channels using a handheld force gauge. At eight sites in California, with reach-averaged bed angles ranging from 0.5° to 23° and channel widths ranging from 2m to 16m, we show that friction angles in natural streams average 68° and are 16° larger than those typically measured in laboratory experiments, which is likely due to particle interlocking and burial. Results also show that larger grains are disproportionately more stable than predicted by existing models and that grains organized into steps are twice as stable as grains outside of steps. However, the mean particle friction angle does not vary systematically with bed slope. These results do not support systematic increases in friction angle in steeper and narrower channels to explain the observed low sediment transport rates in mountain channels. Instead, the spatial pattern and grain-size dependence of particle friction angles may indirectly lower transport rates in steep, narrow channels by stabilizing large clasts and channel-spanning steps, which act as momentum sinks due to form drag.},

abstract = {An experimental study of lift force on a spherical sediment particle at different exposures was conducted in a laboratory flume. It is found that the functional form of the theoretical probability density function (pdf) of lift force similar to that of drag force is inadequate. An improved expression for the pdf based on the normal error law is provided which matches the measured data up to ±3 times the standard deviation of lift force for all exposures. The skewness of the measured lift force is found to increase with increase in exposure. In addition, the kurtosis of the measured lift force is found to be higher than that for a normal distribution for all exposures, resulting in higher probability of occurrence of extreme events (beyond ±3 times standard deviation). A spectral density function of lift force as a function of streamwise and stream-normal velocity is developed and validated using the measured lift force data. The spectrum predicted by the proposed model closely follows the measured spectrum for exposures 7.5 mm and 10 mm while it over predicts at frequencies below 1 Hz for exposures 0 mm and 2.5 mm because of poor coherence between lift force and streamwise velocity. The time history plots of measured lift at lower exposures showed that the high-frequency positive and negative fluctuations of lift correspond to strongly positive streamwise velocity fluctuations, a phenomenon not captured by the predictive model. Predominance of fluctuating Bernoulli's lift over lift due to stream-normal velocity fluctuations is observed at all exposures, more so in the case of lower exposures.},

abstract = {We investigate the stability of steppool channels by examining how the traditional approach to bed stability based on the critical Shields number is modified by particles jamming across the width of the channel. Experiments were conducted in a flume with slopes ranging between 3{\%} and 18{\%} and either smooth or rough walls. By varying the size of sediment and width of the flume we observed that the stability of the bed increases as the jamming ratio (channel width/D84step is the diameter at which 84{\%} of the step stones are smaller) decreases for jamming ratios less than six. At low jamming ratios both grain ongrain structuring and sediment entrainment phenomena affect the stability of the bed. Actual bed failure, however, depends upon the history of bed development and the chance arrangement of the stone structures in the bed. Thus, the experiments also demonstrate that the inherently stochastic nature of sediment transport affects not only the movement of individual grains but also the stability of the channel as a whole. Since stochastic processes affect the stability of the entire channel, there is no clearly defined separation between stable and unstable beds, rather, an overlapping field where both stable and unstable bed states can exist. This field was modeled using logistic regression to derive a probability of bed failure. A comparison of data from experiments with rough banks and smooth banks showed that rough banks significantly increase the stability of the bed.},

abstract = {When a system jams, it undergoes a transition from a flowing to a rigid state. Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the fluid phase. In this way jamming is quite different from crystallization, the other common way in which a fluid solidifies. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many different types of fluids--from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter--develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition.We start with perhaps the simplest model: frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive finite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly idealized case, the transition has aspects of both first- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We first survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable. This includes work that examines the effect of nonspherical particles, friction, and temperature on the excitations and the dynamics. We briefly touch on recent laboratory experiments that have begun to make contact with simulations and theory.},

This paper is intended as an introduction to space-time point process modelling. It includes brief summaries of the most relevant point process properties, starting from the description and estimation of first and second order moment properties, proceeding to a description of conditional intensity or dynamic models, and ending with an introduction to some of the models and estimation procedures which are currently being used in seismology. A short final section contrasts the modelling problems for seismology and for forest fires.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the analysis of the influence of near-bed turbulence structures with the inclusion of existing coherent structures on the entrainment of saltating particles in a water stream from the Lagrangian perspec-tive. The interactions between turbulence structures and initiation of particles movement is the key for better understand-ing of the physics of sediment transport and particles behaviour. These aims are addressed by use of a 3D relevant model of spherical saltating particles, in which a special procedure has been designed to produce coherent structures. In this method, the spectra of turbulent kinetic energy, consisting of four ranges, are used to generate the time series of turbulent velocities in the streamwise, vertical and transversal directions. Numerical results suggest that the initiation of sediment movement is strongly correlated to positive streamwise velocity fluctuations and as such, supports earlier laboratory ex-perimental and field observations, showing that the sweeps and outward interactions play a crucial role in the initiation of saltating particles' movement.},

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

By deploying both numerical simulations and flume experiments, the emergent particle diffusion regimes for both uniform and mixed tracer particles were studied and compared. For uniform particles, power-law-distributed resting times Trproduced super-, sub- or normal diffusion regimes for certain values of the tail exponent {\$}\nu{\$}. Based on the assumption that heterogeneity in particle size leads to a power-law distribution of Tr, a completely different diffusion regime emerges in mixtures compared with those obtained from uniform particles with the same value of the tail exponent {\$}\nu{\$}. Mixtures exhibited the same ballistic regime (the variance of travel distance grows as time squared) for different values of {\$}\nu{\$}, and ballistic regimes for mixtures also emerged from several other tested models. Furthermore, our experimental results confirmed the ballistic regime; however, the decreasing number of tracked particles may result in apparent but deceptive sub-diffusion. We conclude that ballistic regimes for mixtures result from violations of the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumptions, attributing to downstream sorting processes.},

In this paper singular perturbation techniques are used to obtain a bed stress distribution which allows a mobile bed but immobile banks at bankfull or dominant discharge. This result is used to obtain regime relations for straight rivers with bed and banks composed of coarse gravel.

@article{Cao2002,
abstract = {Existing numerical river models are mostly built upon asynchronous solution of simplified governing equations. The strong coupling between water flow, sediment transport, and morphological evolution is thus ignored to a certain extent. An earlier study led to the development of a fully coupled model and identified the impacts of simplifications in the water-sediment mixture and global bed material continuity equations as well as of the asynchronous solution procedure for aggradation processes. This paper presents the results of an extended study along this line, highlighting the impacts on both aggradation and degradation processes. Simplifications in the continuity equations for the water-sediment mixture and bed material are found to have negligible effects on degradation. This is, however, in contrast to aggradation processes, in which the errors purely due to simplified continuity equations can be significant transiently. The asynchronous solution procedure is found to entail appreciable inaccuracy for both aggradation and degradation processes. Further, the asynchronous solution procedure can render the physical problem mathematically ill posed by invoking an extra upstream boundary condition in the supercritical flow regime. Finally, the impacts of simplified continuity equations and an asynchronous solution procedure are shown to be comparable with those of largely tuned friction factors, indicating their significance in calibrating numerical river models. It is concluded that the coupled system of complete governing equations needs to be synchronously solved for refined modeling of alluvial rivers.},

abstract = {Fluid-sheared granular transport sculpts landscapes and undermines infrastructure, yet predicting the onset of sediment transport remains notoriously unreliable. For almost a century, this onset has been treated as a discontinuous transition at which hydrodynamic forces overcome gravity-loaded grain-grain friction. Using a custom laminar-shear flume to image slow granular dynamics deep into the bed, here we find that the onset is instead a continuous transition from creeping to granular flow. This transition occurs inside the dense granular bed at a critical viscous number, similar to granular flows and colloidal suspensions and inconsistent with hydrodynamic frameworks. We propose a new phase diagram for sediment transport, where 'bed load' is a dense granular flow bounded by creep below and suspension above. Creep is characteristic of disordered solids and reminiscent of soil diffusion on hillslopes. Results provide new predictions for the onset and dynamics of sediment transport that challenge existing models.},

An Immersed Boundary Method is used for the numerical representation of the particles. With 22 points per diameter even the viscous scales of the flow are resolved at this Reynolds number. The reference run contains just as many fixed as mobile particles with a relative density slightly above the nominal threshold of incipient motion. Further runs were conducted with decreased mass loading and decreased Shields number together with a simulation containing only immobile particles. The variation of the parameters defining the mobile sediment yields a strong modification of particle-fluid as well as particle-particle interactions yielding different structures in space and time. This is assessed by means of appropriate statistical quantities addressing the continuous and the disperse phase. The results are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations at higher Reynolds number.},

@article{Haff1983,
abstract = {The behaviour of granular material in motion is studied from a continuum point of view. Insofar as possible, individual grains are treated as the ‘molecules' of a granular ‘fluid'. Besides the obvious contrast in shape, size and mass, a key difference between true molecules and grains is that collisions of the latter are inevitably inelastic. This, together with the fact that the fluctuation velocity may be comparable to the flow velocity, necessitates explicit incorporation of the energy equation, in addition to the continuity and momentum equations, into the theoretical description. Simple ‘microscopic' kinetic models are invoked for deriving expressions for the ‘coefficients' of viscosity, thermal diffusivity and energy absorption due to collisions. The ‘coefficients' are not constants, but are functions of the local state of the medium, and therefore depend on the local ‘temperature' and density. In general the resulting equations are nonlinear and coupled. However, in the limit s [double less-than sign] d, where s is the mean separation between neighbouring grain surfaces and d is a grain diameter, the above equations become linear and can be solved analytically. An important dependent variable, in this formulation, in addition to the flow velocity u, is the mean random fluctuation (‘thermal') velocity {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} of an individual grain. With a sufficient flux of energy supplied to the system through the boundaries of the container, {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} can remain non-zero even in the absence of flow. The existence of a non-uniform {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} is the means by which energy can be ‘conducted' from one part of the system to another. Because grain collisions are inelastic, there is a natural (damping) lengthscale, governed by the value of d, which strongly influences the functional dependence of {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} on position. Several illustrative examples of static (u = 0) systems are solved. As an example of grain flow, various Couette-type problems are solved analytically. The pressure, shear stress, and ‘thermal' velocity function {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} are all determined by the relative plate velocity U (and the boundary conditions). If {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} is set equal to zero at both plates, the pressure and stress are both proportional to U2, i.e. the fluid is non-Newtonian. However, if sufficient energy is supplied externally through the walls ({\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}} \backslashne 0{\$} there), then the forces become proportional to the first power of U. Some examples of Couette flow are given which emphasize the large effect on the grain system properties of even a tiny amount of inelasticity in grain–grain collisions. From these calculations it is suggested that, for the case of Couette flow, the flow of sand is supersonic over most of the region between the confining plates.},

abstract = {1 It is a truism in geomorphology that climatic events operate on a landscape to drive sediment transport processes, yet few investigations have formally linked climate and terrain characteristics with geomorphological processes. In this study, we incorporate sediment transport equations derived from fieldwork into a computer model that predicts the delivery of sediment from hillslopes in a steep Mediterranean landscape near Santa Barbara, California. The sediment transport equations are driven by rainstorms and fires that are stochastically generated from probability distributions. The model is used to compare the rates and processes of sediment delivery under two vegetation types: coastal sage scrub and grasslands. Conversion of vegetation from sage to exotic grasses is a common land management strategy in the region and may also be engendered by regional climate change due to global warming. Results from the model suggest that (1) approximately 40{\%} more sediment is delivered from grasslands (98 t km(-2) yr(-1)) than the sage scrub (71 t km(-2) yr(-1)) and (2) chronic soil creep processes dominate under grasslands whereas catastrophic processes dominate under coastal sage scrub. Results from the model also suggest that changes in the spatial distribution of vegetation arising from climate change will have a greater effect on sediment delivery than changes in the magnitude and frequency of meteorological events.},

abstract = {Advances in computing technology, new and ongoing restoration initiatives, concerns about climate change's effects, and the increasing interdisciplinarity of research have encouraged the development of landscape-scale mechanistic models of coupled ecological-geophysical systems. However, communication barriers and uneven infiltration of new strategies for data-driven induction persist in the context of simulation model development across disciplines. One challenge is that ecology and the geosciences have embraced different modeling epistemologies, with ecologists historically favoring inductive inference from generalized, phenomenological models and geoscientists favoring deductive inference from detailed first-principles models. Today, many models used for environmental management, particularly for aquatic ecosystems, tend to be highly detailed, with ecological and geophysical components represented in different modules that are linked but often not closely integrated. These observations highlight a need for cross-disciplinary dialogue about landscape-scale modeling objectives and approaches. The philosophies of pattern-oriented modeling in ecology and exploratory modeling in geophysics have yielded advances in theoretical and applied knowledge in both of those disciplines, but they are not comprehensive across all aspects of landscape-scale modeling. Here we define and synthesize the “Appropriate-Complexity Method” (ACME), which builds upon these two philosophies to guide the development of process-oriented models across a spectrum of scientific and management objectives. ACME helps modelers efficiently converge upon an optimal modeling structure through: i) systematic evaluation of the attributes that comprise computational and representational detail, for which we have developed an operational decision tree; ii) iterative adjustment of models based on pattern-oriented model evaluation strategies; and iii) the use of appropriate datasets (where applicable) to build conceptual models and formulate predictions. Decisions about aspects of computational and representational detail are based on the landscape's emergent properties. They are also based on a hierarchy of classes of questions governing model objectives that represent a multi-attribute tradeoff among validation potential, interpretability, tractability, and generality as functions of computational and representational detail. Tradeoff curves, together with model objectives, provide further guidance for determining the “appropriate” level of complexity for representation of processes in models. Once deemed adequate for addressing the original research question of interest, models may be used for projection and scenario testing. They may next undergo expansion that moves them down the hierarchy, where they can then be used to address research questions of higher specificity, detail, and validation potential, though at a cost of lower tractability and interpretability on the tradeoff curves. This practical, systematic procedure provides clear guidance for the design and improvement of landscape models that may be used to address a wide variety of questions relevant to restoration, over a spectrum of scales.},

abstract = {The ability to automatically detect certain types of cells or cellular subunits in microscopy images is of significant interest to a wide range of biomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods have evolved from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques. The essential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are trained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In this paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output pixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely labeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. We employ random projections to encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN regresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Furthermore, it is possible to stably recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from the predicted compressed vector using {\$}L{\_}1{\$}-norm optimization. In the past, output space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in conjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space encoding. We made substantial experiments on several benchmark datasets, where the proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as CNNCS) achieved the highest or at least top-3 performance in terms of F1-score, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Models for random porous media are considered. The models are isotropic both from the local and the macroscopic point of view; that is, the pores have spherical shape or their surface shows piecewise spherical curvature, and there is no macroscopic gradient of any geometrical feature. Both closed-pore and open-pore systems are discussed. The Poisson grain model, the model of hard spheres packing, and the penetrable sphere model are used; variable size distribution of the pores is included. A parameter is introduced which controls the degree of open-porosity. Besides systems built up by a single solid phase, models for porous media with the internal surface coated by a second phase are treated. Volume fraction, surface area, and correlation functions are given explicitly where applicable; otherwise numerical methods for determination are described. Effective medium theory is applied to calculate physical properties for the models such as isotropic elastic moduli, thermal and electrical conductivity, and static dielectric constant. The methods presented are exemplified by applications: small-angle scattering of systems showing fractal-like behavior in limited ranges of linear dimension, optimization of nanoporous insulating materials, and improvement of properties of open-pore systems by atomic layer deposition of a second phase on the internal surface.},

Experiments were performed tracking individual particles under different bed conditions (mobile and fixed beds) at transitional hydrodynamic regimes. A new image processing procedure was designed to obtain the coordinates of each moving sediment within the intermediate range of scales (corresponding to a particle trajectory between rests periods). Thorough attention has been paid to provide consistent definitions for particle motion and trajectory, as well as to devise a rigorous method for analysis. A data set with properties of more than 4000 intermediate trajectories was obtained. Collected data were used to estimate stream-wise and transversal length and duration of intermediate trajectories and corresponding mean sediment velocities. Statistical significance of the values obtained for measured properties was ascertained by appropriate analysis. The full data set is provided with the manuscript as supplementary material.},

abstract = {Depth profiles of particle streamwise velocity, concentration and bedload sediment transport rate were measured in a turbulent and supercritical water flow. One-size 6 mm diameter spherical glass beads were transported at equilibrium in a two-dimensional 10{\%} steep channel with a mobile bed. Flows were filmed from the side by a high-speed camera. Particle tracking algorithms made it possible to determine the position, velocity and trajectory of a very large number of particles. Approximately half of the sediment transport rate was composed by rolling grains, and the other half by saltation. This revealed a complex structure, with several concentration and flux peaks due to rolling, and one peak due to saltation. With an increase of the sediment transport rate, the depth structure remained the same at the water/granular interface, with peak value increases but with no shift in elevations. The saltation region expanded towards higher elevations with an increase of the particle velocity commensurate to the water velocity. The proportion of the sediment transport rate in saltation did not vary significantly. The particle streamwise velocity profiles exhibited three segments: an exponential decay in the bed, a linear increase where rolling and saltation coexisted, and above this, a logarithmic-like shape due to saltating particles. These results are comparable to profiles measured and modelled in dry granular free surface flows and in more intense bedload such as sheet flows. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Temporally and spatially averaged models of bedload transport are inadequate to describe the highly variable nature of particle motion at low transport stages. The primary sources of this variability are the resisting forces to downstream motion resulting from the geometrical relation (pocket friction angle) of a bed grain to the grains that it rests upon, variability of the near-bed turbulent velocity field and the local modification of this velocity field by upstream, protruding grains. A model of bedload transport is presented that captures these sources of variability by directly integrating the equations of motion of each particle of a simulated mixed grain-size sediment bed. Experimental data from the velocity field downstream and below the tops of upstream, protruding grains are presented. From these data, an empirical relation for the velocity modification resulting from upstream grains is provided to the bedload model. The temporal variability of near-bed turbulence is provided by a measured near-bed time series of velocity over a gravel bed. The distribution of pocket friction angles results as a consequence of directly calculating the initiation and cessation of motion of each particle as a result of the combination of fluid forcing and interaction with other particles. Calculations of bedload flux in a uniform boundary and simulated pocket friction angles agree favourably with previous studies.},

Turning our attention to spatially 1-D CTRWs with a generic power law jump distribution, "rescaling" space can be interpreted as a second kind of "respeeding" which then, again under a proper relation between the relevant parameters leads in the limit to the space-time fractional diffusion equation. Finally, we treat the `time fractional drift" process as a properly scaled limit of the counting number of a Mittag-Leffler renewal process.},

abstract = {Bedforms in gravel-bed rivers range in size from 10-2 to 103 m and have a wide range of affects on sediment transport and channel stability. To study the affect of these bedforms on sediment transport a classification scheme is proposed that breaks the bedforms into micro, meso, macro and megaforms. Then using two creeks in British Columbia and one in California, the trend of sediment transport rates is related to the bed state, sediment and wood storage and the associated bedforms are discussed. At small spatial and temporal scales (micro/mesoform scales), variability in sediment transport rate can be ascribed to the changing state of the bed, which largely depends on the sediment supply regime. Stabilizing bedforms develop when sediment supply is low, and reduces the depth of the bed active layer and the mobility of the grains, thereby decreasing the sediment transport rate. Sediment rating relations in a low sediment supply channel are steep and are believed to be extremely sensitive to small changes in sediment supply and flow regime when compared to higher sediment supply systems. High sediment supply suppresses the development of stabilizing bedforms and increases the mobility of grains and the depth of the active layer. At the reach scale (macroform scale), high sediment mobility is shown to produce complex cycles of aggradation and degradation that can persist for decades. In-channel woody debris can strongly influence the timing and magnitude of these aggradation-degradation cycles and also has an important effect on the development of megaforms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

abstract = {Estimates of sediment transport rates in gravel-bed rivers are typically developed from formulae or from a sampling campaign. The former are notoriously inaccurate; the latter require a large effort and may still not achieve acceptable accuracy. A wide range of geomorphological problems, particularly those at the watershed scale, could be addressed more accurately if reliable local estimates of transport rate could be incorporated routinely into such studies. This requires a method for estimating transport rate with acceptable accuracy and a minimum of effort. A consistent approach to estimating transport is not just a matter of which formula or sampler to use; a suitable approach requires a consistent and reliable scaling of the water discharge and an integral description of the sediment that is both meaningful and practical. An approach proposed here, using a few observations of small transport rates to calibrate a transport formula, is likely to provide a superior combination of accuracy and effort and substantially reduces flow-scaling error. Small transport rates can be measured effectively using pit samplers, which allow the sampling periods needed for accurate measurements. Grain size can be represented as two fractions, sand and gravel, which capture some of the important transport dynamics and effectively represent important environmental problems within a tractable methodological approach. The approach is nearly independent of the uncertainty associated with measuring slope and bed grain-size in the field.},

abstract = {Meandering rivers are common on Earth and other planetary surfaces, yet the conditions necessary to maintain meandering channels are unclear. As a consequence, self-maintaining meandering channels with cutoffs have not been reproduced in the laboratory. Such experimental channels are needed to explore mechanisms controlling migration rate, sinuosity, floodplain formation, and planform morphodynamics and to test theories for wavelength and bend propagation. Here we report an experiment in which meandering with near-constant width was maintained during repeated cutoff and regeneration of meander bends. We found that elevated bank strength (provided by alfalfa sprouts) relative to the cohesionless bed material and the blocking of troughs (chutes) in the lee of point bars via suspended sediment deposition were the necessary ingredients to successful meandering. Varying flood discharge was not necessary. Scaling analysis shows that the experimental meander migration was fast compared to most natural channels. This high migration rate caused nearly all of the bedload sediment to exchange laterally, such that bar growth was primarily dependent on bank sediment supplied from upstream lateral migration. The high migration rate may have contributed to the relatively low sinuosity of 1.19, and this suggests that to obtain much higher sinuosity experiments at this scale may have to be conducted for several years. Although patience is required to evolve them, these experimental channels offer the opportunity to explore several fundamental issues about river morphodynamics. Our results also suggest that sand supply may be an essential control in restoring self-maintaining, actively shifting gravel-bedded meanders.},

abstract = {Glasses are rigid, but flow when the temperature is increased. Similarly, granular materials are rigid, but become unjammed and flow if sufficient shear stress is applied. The rigid and flowing phases are strikingly different, yet measurements reveal that the structures of glass and liquid are virtually indistinguishable. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a structural signature of the jammed granular state that distinguishes it from its flowing counterpart. Here we find evidence for such a signature, by measuring the contact-force distribution between particles during shearing. Because the forces are sensitive to minute variations in particle position, the distribution of forces can serve as a microscope with which to observe correlations in the positions of nearest neighbours. We find a qualitative change in the force distribution at the onset of jamming. If, as has been proposed, the jamming and glass transitions are related, our observation of a structural signature associated with jamming hints at the existence of a similar structural difference at the glass transition--presumably too subtle for conventional scattering techniques to uncover. Our measurements also provide a determination of a granular temperature that is the counterpart in granular systems to the glass-transition temperature in liquids.},

The proposed model incorporates an exchange process between the bed load and the suspended load layer, in addition to the interface between the bed-load layer and the bed material, as normally considered in most of the existing sediment transport studies. In this study the mathematical treatment of the continuous-time Markov chain is clarified to stress the difference in definitions of the continuous-time and discrete-time Markov chains. With the employment of the continuous-time Markov model, the bed-load transport capacity in the long run and the time-varying transport rates can be derived. On the other hand, the three-state model can assist in distinguishing whether the flow is subject to significant suspended load or not. Furthermore, the distribution of particles in each of the three layers can be quantified. The proposed model is validated against natural river data. The comparison has shown a reasonably good agreement and thus the validity of the proposed model is confirmed.},

abstract = {[1] We conducted a series of flume experiments to investigate the response of self-formed gravel-bed channels to floods of varying magnitude and duration. Floods were generated by increasing the discharge into a channel created in sand-and gravel-sized sediment with a median grain size of 2 mm. Flooding increased the Shields stress along the channel perimeter, causing bank erosion and rapid channel widening. The sediment introduced to the channel by bank erosion was not necessarily deposited on the channel bed, but was rather transported downstream, a process likely facilitated by transient fining of the bed surface. At the end of each experiment, bank sediments were no longer in motion, " partial bed load transport " characterized the flat-bed portion of the channel, and the Shields stress approached a constant value of 0.056, about 1.2 times the critical Shields stress for incipient motion. Furthermore, the discharge was entirely accommodated by flow within the channel: the creation of a stable channel entirely eliminated overbank flows. We speculate that similar processes may occur in nature, but only where bank sediments are non-cohesive and where channel-narrowing processes cannot counteract bank erosion during overbank flows. We also demonstrate that a simple model of lateral bed load transport can reproduce observed channel widening rates, suggesting that simple methods may be appropriate for predicting width increases in channels with non-cohesive, unvegetated banks, even during overbank flows. Last, we present a model for predicting the equilibrium width and depth of a stable gravel-bed channel with a known channel-forming Shields stress.},

abstract = {High-speed imaging of coarse sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed reveals that the particle activity, the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area, fluctuates as particles respond to near-bed fluid turbulence while simultaneously interacting with the bed. The relative magnitude of these fluctuations systematically varies with the size of the sampling area. The particle activity within a specified sampling area is distributed in a manner that is consistent with the existence of an ensemble of configurations of particle positions wherein certain configurations are preferentially selected or excluded by the turbulence structure, manifest as patchiness of active particles. The particle activity increases with increasing bed stress far faster than does the average particle velocity, so changes in the transport rate with changing stress are dominated by changes in the activity, not velocity. The probability density functions of the streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like and lack heavy tails. Plots of the mean squared particle displacement versus time may ostensibly indicate non-Fickian diffusive behavior while actually reflecting effects of correlated random walks associated with intrinsic periodicities in particle motions, not anomalous diffusion. The probability density functions of the particle hop distance (start-to-stop) and the associated travel time are gamma-like, which provides the empirical basis for showing that particle disentrainment rates vary with hop distance and travel time.},

abstract = {Granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and important in various applications such as road and railway engineering. Granular materials exhibit complicated mechanical behaviors, which are affected significantly by the irregular shape of particles. Currently, the discrete element method (DEM) has been accepted as an effective approach to investigate the mechanical behaviors of granular materials. However, there are scarce simulations based on DEM in literatures considering the irregularity of particle shape. A new method is proposed to simulate individual real particle with irregular shape using clump constituted by overlapping spheres. First, the geometric model of real particle with surface nodes and inner nodes is established through digitally processing the computerized tomography (CT) scanning data. Second, a clump consisting of spheres is generated to simulate the real particle using a minimum distance criterion. The criterion is implemented by tree optimization algorithm. Influential factors are also introduced to balance the model accuracy and computing cost. Effects of the influential factors, including the density of geometric grid and the minimum distance, on simulations are discussed. Results show that this new method is simpler and more efficient than the previous methods in terms of the model accuracy and computing cost.},

abstract = {Large wood along rivers influences entrainment, transport, and storage of mineral sediment and particulate organic matter. We review how wood alters sediment dynamics and explore patterns among volumes of in-stream wood, sediment storage, and residual pools for dispersed pieces of wood, logjams, and beaver dams. We hypothesized that: volume of sediment per unit area of channel stored in association with wood is inversely proportional to drainage area; the form of sediment storage changes downstream; sediment storage correlates with wood load; the residual volume of pools created in association with wood correlates inversely with drainage area; and volume of sediment stored behind beaver dams correlates with pond area. Lack of data from larger drainage areas limits tests of these hypotheses, but the analyses suggest that sediment volume correlates positively with drainage area and wood volume. The form of sediment storage in relation to wood appears to change downstream, with wedges of sediment upstream from jammed steps most prevalent in small, steep channels and more dispersed sediment storage in lower gradient channels. Pool volume correlates positively with wood volume and negatively with channel gradient. Sediment volume correlates well with beaver pond area. More abundant in-stream wood and beaver populations present historically equated to greater sediment storage within river corridors and greater residual pool volume. One implication of these changes is that protecting and re-introducing wood and beavers can be used to restore rivers. This review of the existing literature on wood and sediment dynamics highlights the lack of studies on larger rivers. Copyright {\textcopyright}2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The sensitivity of the particle friction factor, restitution coefficient, and spring stiffness used in the soft sphere collision model is tested in the three regimes of sediment transport comprising of essentially no motion, bed load, and suspended load flow regimes. The simulations are run for 10 s using base values of the parameters of interest (reference calculation), then one parameter is changed at a time and the corresponding change in quantitative result is observed for the following 15 s where averaged results in the last 10 s are compared to the reference calculation. The sensitivity analysis shows that the underpredicted sediment transport in the suspended load regime can be bridged by moderately decreasing the friction factor of the particles from 0.6 to 0.25. The impact of the same change in bed load regime is not as significant. Both the coefficient of restitution and the particle stiffness show less significant to negligible impact as compared to the friction factor.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Accurately estimating the 3D position of underwater objects is of great interest when doing research on marine animals. An inherent problem of 3D reconstruction of underwater positions is the presence of refraction which invalidates the assumption of a single viewpoint. Three ways of performing 3D reconstruction on underwater objects are compared in this work: an approach relying solely on in-air camera calibration, an approach with the camera calibration performed under water and an approach based on ray tracing with Snell's law. As expected, the in-air camera calibration showed to be the most inaccurate as it does not take refraction into account. The precision of the estimated 3D positions based on the underwater camera calibration and the ray tracing based approach were, on the other hand, almost identical. However, the ray tracing based approach is found to be advantageous as it is far more flexible in terms of the calibration procedure due to the decoupling of the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters.},

abstract = {Gravel-river beds typically have an "armored" layer of coarse grains on the surface, which acts to protect finer particles underneath from erosion. River bed-load transport is a kind of dense granular flow, and such flows are known to vertically segregate grains. The contribution of granular physics to river-bed armoring, however, has not been investigated. Here we examine these connections in a laboratory river with bimodal sediment size, by tracking the motion of particles from the surface to deep inside the bed, and find that armor develops by two distinct mechanisms. Bed-load transport in the near-surface layer drives rapid segregation, with a vertical advection rate proportional to the granular shear rate. Creeping grains beneath the bed-load layer give rise to slow but persistent segregation, which is diffusion dominated and insensitive to shear rate. We verify these findings with a continuum phenomenological model and discrete element method simulations. Our results suggest that river beds armor by granular segregation from below --- rather than fluid-driven sorting from above --- while also providing new insights on the mechanics of segregation that are relevant to a wide range of granular flows.},

abstract = {Excess sediment production in the upper parts of catchments may result in important impacts over morphodynamics of gravel bed-rivers. By changing morphodynamics, sediment overfeed-ing may induce important changes in the structure of near-bed flow, mainly in what concerns exchange of momentum and mass between flow within the roughness elements and flow in the upper regions. It is not well-known how turbulent statistics, including those characterizing the bursting cycle, are affected by bed load transport, for mobile but geometrically similar beds. This study addresses this issue. It is aimed at evaluating the impacts of sediment transport on flow hydrodynamics, namely on statistics of turbulent coherent structures. In order to accomplish the proposed objective, laboratory tests were undertaken. Two-dimensional instantaneous flow velocity fields in the stream-wise and vertical directions were meas-ured with Particle Image Velocimetry. Two laboratory tests simulated a framework gravel bed with sand matrix and a framework gravel bed with sand matrix but with sediment transport imposed at near capacity conditions. The framework con-sists of coarse gravel whose diameters range between 0.5 cm and 7 cm and is kept immobile under the imposed flow conditions. The mobile sediments are sand with a mean diameter of 0.9 mm. For both tests, the quadrant threshold analysis technique was employed and shear stress distribution statistics were ana-lyzed and discussed in what concerns their contribution and persistence. In the case of mobile conditions, sweep events tend to govern the flow in the near-bed region. Relevant differences between mobile and sub-threshold beds are found in the wake of roughness elements, mostly for sweep statistics. In the presence of bed-load, ejection events decrease their participation in the shear stress production processes. This decrease in the ejection events contribution is partially balanced with an increase in the frequency of inward events. concluded that the presence of intense intermittent sediment transport increases the extreme values of shear stress while the flow becomes more organ-ized in the second and fourth quadrants, mainly increasing the importance of sweep events to tur-bulence production, while Ferreira et al. (2009) sug-gested that further research was needed to clarify the nature of feedback effects between turbulent flow organization and sediment fluxes. Fundamental questions remain unsolved in what concerns flow organization under sediment transport conditions, specially in ejections and sweep events which are the major contribuitors to the Reynolds shear stress production among the bursting cycle. The purpose of this work is to to contribute to the understanding of coherent structures that},

abstract = {In this work, we developed a method to decipher the shape message imprinted in single sediment particles, a method that would reflect the detail information of surface morphology. It uses 2D mathematical descriptions to restore and characterize 3D shape and surface morphology of sediment particles in terms of the "mathematical sediment", so as to better understand 3D geometric characteristics reflected by single sediment particles. To prevent the simplification of morphology description and overcome the deficiencies of lower-dimensional characteristics, we proposed a concept of "mathematical sediment" in this paper. The mathematical sediment uses image analysis of scanning electron microscope photographs and complex Fourier shape analysis to describe the planar projection shape of sediment particles and further restore the 3D morphology of sediment particles through a certain combination ways. The shapes of sediment particles are controlled using Fourier coefficients to generate a variety of mathematical sediments with various shapes, which allow the realization of the description and analysis of the 3D morphology of sediment particles. The fractal theory is further used to verify the rationality of mathematical sediment. Compared with the traditional method, the mathematical sediment overcomes the lack of particle system and smooth sphere systems and can reproduce 3D irregular surfaces for the morphology analysis. The rationality verification showed that the complex surface morphology of mathematical sediment is basically similar to the surface morphology of natural sediment. The mathematical sediment can reflect the true surface characteristics of sediment particles. The characteristics of shape properties and surface morphology it conveys are consistent with the natural sediment and can be used as a research basis for the further study both in fresh water and marine.},

abstract = {The fluvial riparian and aquatic patch mosaic varies along rivers according to geomorphological setting, hydrological regime, sediment supply and surface-groundwater connectivity. This relation between physical processes and plants is not unidirectional. Once established, riparian and aquatic plants frequently act as physical ecosystem engineers by trapping and stabilising sediments, organic matter and the propagules of other plant species, modifying the local sedimentary and morphological environment by driving the development of landforms and associated habitats, and so facilitating the rapid establishment of other plants that can in turn reinforce the development of landforms such as river banks, vegetated islands and floodplains. This paper reviews knowledge on the hydrogeomorphological significance of riparian and aquatic vegetation with a particular emphasis on humid temperate, mixed load, gravel bed, floodplain rivers.First, we investigate how vegetation dynamics across river margins are governed by hydrological processes that can both promote riparian vegetation growth and disturb and destroy riparian and aquatic vegetation. We show, with some simple numerical modeling, that different combinations of moisture supply and flow disturbance have the potential to generate many different responses in the lateral distribution of vegetation biomass along river corridors.Second, building on the varied lateral biomass distributions that are primarily dictated by hydrological processes, we review research evaluating characteristic vegetation-mediated landform development. We investigate aquatic and riparian plants acting as physical ecosystem engineers by creating and modifying habitats in river systems with sufficient suspended sediment supply for habitat or landform building. These plants have a crucial impact on sediment stabilisation and pioneer landform building along the interface between plant (resistance) dominated and fluvial-disturbance (force) dominated zones of the river corridor. We present some examples of vegetation-mediated landforms along rivers with strongly contrasting hydrological regimes and thus lateral distributions of vegetation.Lastly, we present a conceptual synthetic model that links the development of pioneer landforms by engineering plants with river morphology and morphodynamics in humid temperate, mixed load, gravel bed, floodplain rivers. Drawing on four example rivers, we show how different plants and pioneer landforms act at the interface between the plant dominated and fluvial-disturbance dominated zones of the river corridor as river energy and vegetation colonisation and growth change. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Double-averaged turbulence characteristics in a uniform flow over a gravel bed are studied. The log-law for the velocity is preserved above the interfacial sublayer, while the velocity within that sublayer follows a polynomial law. The Reynolds shear stress distribution within the roughness sublayer has a considerable damping. A quadrant analysis suggests that the sweeps become the prevalent mechanism within the interfacial sublayer. Within the interfacial sublayer, the quadrant plots of the form-induced velocities form a tilted pseudo-elliptical shape, suggesting that the fluid undergoes a cyclic process of upward-streamwise deceleration and downward-streamwise acceleration. An upward-downstream flux of the turbulent kinetic energy is prevalent over the entire flow depth, while a downward-upstream flux corresponding to sweep events is the mechanism within the interfacial sublayer. The energy budget indicates that the turbulent production, dissipation and diffusion, having attained their peaks, reduce sharply within the interfacial sublayer, and the pressure energy diffusion changes drastically to a negative magnitude below the virtual bed level.},

abstract = {Existing bed-load transport formulas may overestimate the transport rate in mountain rivers by two orders of magnitude or more. Recently published field data sets provide an opportunity to take a fresh look at the bed-load transport relationship and it is hypothesized that the overestimate is due to a failure to account for the effect of a coarse surface layer of bed material inhibiting the release of fine subsurface material. Bed-load transport is determined as gs=aq−qc where qwater discharge per unit width; qccritical value for initiation of bed material movement; water density; and acoefficient. The gs /q relationship is typically piecewise linear, characterized by two transport phases with, respectively, low and high rates of change. Twenty-one flume and 25 field data sets were used to quantify the relationship for Phase 2. The flume data confirm the dependence of a on S1.5, where Schannel slope, in agreement with earlier studies. The field data additionally show that a varies inversely with the degree of bed armoring, given by the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material size. The finding is consistent with the hypothesis and suggests the need to account for the bed material supply limitation in the bed-load transport formula. However, the available data are not entirely sufficient to rule out an alternative dependency, or codependency, on flow resistance. The critical conditions for initiation of Phase 2 transport are also quantified as a function of bed material size and channel slope. The resulting set of equations allows a more accurate estimation of Phase 2 bed-load transport rates. However, the equations are empirical and should be restricted for use within the range of conditions used in their development, to determine mean rather than instantaneous transport rates and to determine bulk transport rates, not transport by size fraction.},

abstract = {15 There is a wide variety of bed features that develop in gravel-bedded rivers that are smaller than 16 the channel-scale but larger than the individual grains. The features include gravel dunes, 17 bedload sheets, sandy bedforms developed over immobile gravel armor layers (sand ribbons, 18 barchans dunes, dunes with gaps in the troughs) and structural features of armor layers (clusters, 19 ribs and reticulate cells). We argue that with the exception of gravel dunes, the emergence of 20 these features is controlled by sediment supply and the differential mobility of grain size 21 distributions (equal, selective and partial mobility). Flow conditions play an important but 22 subsidiary role in the development of supply-limited bed features. We plot experimental data in 23 the phase space created by metrics of sediment supply and differential mobility and show the 24 different types of features appear in unique areas of the plot. Abstraction of the result to a phase 25 diagram reveals the inter-relations between bed features. The phase diagram provides a common 26 conceptual framework for studying supply-limited bed features in gravel-bedded rivers. 27 28},

The noise is defined by its spectral density proportional to $\omega$$\delta$-1 at low frequencies, with 0 {\textless} $\delta$ {\textless} 1 (subdiffusion) or 1 {\textless} $\delta$ {\textless} 2 (superdiffusion). Using Laplace analysis, we derive analytic expressions in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions for the correlation functions of the velocity and of the displacement. While the velocity thermalizes at large times (slowly, in contrast to the standard Brownian motion case $\delta$ = 1), the displacement never attains equilibrium: it ages. We thus show that this feature of normal diffusion is shared by a subdiffusive or superdiffusive motion. We provide a closed form analytic expression for the fluctuation-dissipation ratio characterizing aging. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Two types of experiments, namely, movable and fixed balls, were conducted using spherical roughness-element beds with particle image velocimetry to measure the instantaneous flow-velocity field. Miniature piezoelectric pressure sensors were used to capture the instantaneous pressure on the surface of the sphere. Movable ball experiments reveal the predominance of large sweep structures at the instant of entrainment. Fixed ball experiments carried out at entrainment conditions show the importance of both vertical and horizontal pressure gradients on the ball leading to entrainment. Probability distribution function plots of pressures based on quadrant analysis of velocities also reveal the higher probability of occurrence of high magnitude force induced by sweep ( Q4 ) events.},

Such models are highly dependent on arbitrary parameterization and such limitations prevent both the complexity of the system and the feedback between processes being accurately represented. It is suggested here that an improvement in the empirical transport relations used in the morphodynamic modelling of gravel-bed rivers can potentially be derived from a combined computational fluid dynamics approach linked with a discrete particle model. It is proposed that this form of model, used under different hydraulic conditions and sediment particle characteristics, could provide process informed ranges of particle size-specific entrainment, transport and deposition characteristics which can be encapsulated in a probability distribution. Such process information could then be used to improve spatial and/or temporal parameterizations of reach-length morphodynamic models.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A 3D Lagrangian model of the saltation of solid spherical particles on the bed of an open channel flow, accounting for turbulence-induced mechanisms, is proposed and employed as the key tool of the study. The differences between conventional 2D models and a proposed 3D saltation model are discussed and the advantages of the 3D model are highlighted. Particularly, the 3D model includes a special procedure allowing generation of 3D flow velocity fields. This procedure is based on the assumption that the spectra of streamwise, vertical and transverse velocity components are known at any distance from the bed. The 3D model was used to identify and quantify effects of turbulence on particle entrainment and saltation. The analysis of particle trajectories focused on their diffusive nature, clarifying: (i) the effect of particle mobility parameter; (ii) the effect of bed topography; and (iii) the effect of turbulence. Specifically, the results of numerical simulations describing the abovementioned effects on the change in time of the variance are presented. In addition, the change in time of the skewness and kurtosis, which are likely to reflect the turbulence influence on the spread of particles, are also shown. Two different diffusion regimes (local and intermediate) for each of the investigated flow conditions are confidently identified.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Balmforth2012,
abstract = {The St Venant equations in conjunction with a phenomenological law for erosion are used to explore the nonlinear dynamics of cyclic steps – linearly unstable bedform patterns which emerge when uniform flow over an erodible bed becomes supercritical. The instability saturates by blocking the overlying flow and creating hydraulic jumps just downstream of the steepest part of the steps. Near onset, steadily migrating, nonlinear step patterns are constructed and shown to suffer a short-wavelength secondary instability that ‘roughens' the bed and renders the staircase patterns less regular and time-dependent. An eddy viscosity is needed to regularize both the onset of the primary steps and the secondary instabilities. Further beyond the critical Froude number, the steps block the flow sufficiently to arrest erosion significantly, creating complicated patterns mixing migrating steps and stationary bedforms. The reduction in flux also stabilizes roll waves – a second, hydrodynamic instability of uniform supercritical flow. It is further shown that roll waves are purely convective instabilities, whereas cyclic steps can be absolute. Thus, in the finite geometries of the laboratory or field, it may be difficult to excite roll waves. On the other hand, the complicated spatiotemporal patterns associated with the cyclic-step instability should develop naturally. The complicated patterns resulting from the secondary instability do not appear to have been observed experimentally, calling into question the validity of the model.},

abstract = {Experiments are reported on the dynamics of a bed of particles sheared by a viscous Couette flow in an annular channel, with emphasis on the distributions of particle velocities, durations and lengths of the small saltation flights, and surface density of the moving particles. The velocity distributions are shown to decay approximately exponentially, with mean value, U-p, equal to 0.1 gammad, where gamma is the shear rate and d is the particle diameter. The duration of the flights does not depend on the shear rate, and is equal to 15 times the settling time d/V-s, where V-s is the Stokes settling velocity. Starting from an initially loosely packed bed, the surface density of the moving particles, N-p, was observed to decrease slowly over several days, unlike their velocity which remains constant with time. This decay is related to the increase of the threshold shear rate for particle motion, and corresponds to rearrangement of the particles near the bed surface (armouring). When the stationary state is reached, Np depends linearly on the shear rate, so that the particle flow rate, Q(p)=NpUp, is a quadratic function of the shear rate. Two theoretical models are proposed to account for these observations. In the first one, the erosion and deposition rates are modelled using the two hydrodynamic time scales: the inverse shear rate gamma(-1) for the erosion rate, and the settling time d/V-s for the deposition rate. This model accounts for the linear dependence of Np on the shear rate. The second model was developed to capture the slow decrease of N-p, by considering the trapping of moving particles into troughs of the bed. This trapping model does recover the main features observed experimentally, although the characteristic time for the decrease of Np still remains too short. Our observations are, finally, compared to existing numerical and experimental studies on turbulent flows.},

For regular particles like spheres and ellipsoids, the mathematics are straightforward. For random particles, with realistic shapes, mathematically characterizing the shape had not been generally done. But since about the year 2002, a method has been developed that combines X-ray computed tomography and spherical harmonic analysis to give analytical, differentiable mathematical functions for the three-dimensional shape of star-shape particles, which are a wide class of particles covering most industrial particles of interest, ranging from micrometer scale to millimeter scale particles. This review article describes how this is done, in some detail, and then gives examples of applications of this method, including a contact function that is suitable for these random shape particles. The purpose of this article is to make these ideas widely available for the general powder researcher who knows that particle shape is important to his/her applications, and especially for those researchers who are just starting out in their particle science and technology careers.},

abstract = {Desert ephemeral gravel bed streams typically have bed surfaces that are relatively unarmored compared to the substrate below, while gravel bed streams in humid and snowmelt areas typically have well-armored surfaces. The degree of armoring can be characterized in terms of an armor ratio defined as the ratio of the surface median size to the substrate median size. A set of field data shows desert ephemeral gravel bed streams with armor ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 and with an average value of 1.2. The armor ratio of snowmelt-fed gravel bed streams in the same set ranges from 2 to 7, with an average value of 3.4. The reason for this difference is sought in terms of differing hydrological characteristics and sediment supply regimes. Thirteen experiments were conducted to study the formation of armoring under a range of hydrological conditions. The experiments have two limiting cases: a relatively flat hydrograph that represents conditions produced by continuous snowmelt and a sharply peaked hydrograph that represents conditions associated with flash floods. All constant hydrograph experiments developed a well-armored structured surface, while short asymmetrical hydrographs did not result in substantial vertical sorting. All symmetrical hydrographs show some degree of sorting, and the sorting tended to become more pronounced with longer duration. Sediment supply appears to be a first-order control on bed surface armoring, while the shape of the hydrograph plays a secondary role.},

abstract = {Bed load transport formulae have not been tested extensively over medium spatial and temporal scales. The lack of such testing is undoubtedly due to a paucity of field data available for testing at these scales. Extensive transport, morphologic, and discharge data, available for a 10-year period along an 8-km study reach of the Vedder River, British Columbia, are used to test the predictive capabilities of bed load transport formulae at medium scales. The transport data were obtained using the morphologic approach, which is based on the premise that changes in channel morphology reflect the transfer of sediment. Such transport estimates can be made over larger spatial and temporal scales than is possible using traditional measurement techniques. This study focuses on evaluating the original and revised versions of the Bagnold stream power formula, the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula and a stream power correlation. Overall, the formulae are found to underpredict gravel transport rates for the Vedder River. The discrepancy is particularly pronounced in 1982-1983 and 1987-1990, which are periods during which significant dredging occurred. Dredging activity may have loosened the bed structure or resulted in a disequilibrium morphology, thereby increasing sediment movement. Analysis is undertaken to assess how the use of mean daily discharge vs. 15-min increment discharge series affects transport predictions. Results show that only the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula is particularly sensitive to which discharge series is used in calculations. Modification of the Shields parameter is found to significantly affect transport predictions, although it cannot explain alone the discrepancies between field data and calculated results. Predictions of total deposition in the study reach are well within an order-of-magnitude for all equations. The Bagnold-type formulae and the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula do not capture the relatively even distribution of deposition along the study reach. Surprisingly, the simple stream power correlation captured this downstream pattern of deposition. Cumulative distributions of predicted bed load transport are found to be most realistic for the original and revised Bagnold formulae. Results of this study do not suggest that one particular formula is consistently preferred. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Despite its resemblance to numerous real-world phenomena, the singular nature of the resultant spatial distribution of each particle precludes the possibility of any a posteriori empirical validation of this random-walk model from data. Here we show that by simply allowing for random speeds, the ballistic terms are regularized and that the diffusion component can be well-approximated via the unscented transform. The result is a computationally efficient yet robust evaluation of the full particle path probabilities and, hence, the parameter likelihoods of this generalized telegraph process. We demonstrate how a population diffusing under such a model can lead to non-Gaussian asymptotic spatial distributions, thereby mimicking the behavior of an ensemble of Levy walkers.},

Experiments with gravel particles (transported as bed load) are selected to calibrate the mathematical model using the lift coefficient as a free parameter. The model is used to compute the saltation heights and lengths for a range of flow conditions. The computational results are used to determine simple relationships for the saltation characteristics. Measured transport rates of the bed load are used to compute the sediment concentration in the bed‐load layer. A simple expression specifying the bed‐load concentration as a function of the flow and sediment conditions is proposed. A verification analysis using about 600 (alternative) data shows that about 77{\%} of the predicted bed load‐transport rates are within 0.5 and 2 times the observed values.},

abstract = {Riparian vegetation can significantly influence the morphology of a river, affecting channel geometry and flow dynamics. To examine the effects of riparian vegetation on gravel bed braided streams, we conducted a series of physical experiments at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory with varying densities of bar and bank vegetation. Water discharge, sediment discharge, and grain size were held constant between runs. For each run, we allowed a braided system to develop, then seeded the flume with alfalfa (Medicago sativa), allowed the seeds to grow, and then continued the run. We collected data on water depth, surface velocity, and bed elevation throughout each run using image- based techniques designed to collect data over a large spatial area with minimal disturbance to the flow. Our results show that the influence of vegetation on overall river patterns varied systematically with the spatial density of plant stems. Vegetation reduced the number of active channels and increased bank stability, leading to lower lateral migration rates, narrower and deeper channels, and increased channel relief. These effects increased with vegetation density. Vegetation influenced flow dynamics, increasing the variance of flow direction in vegetated runs and increasing scour depths through strong downwelling where the flow collided with relatively resistant banks. This oblique bank collision also provides a new mechanism for producing secondary flows. We found it to be more important than the classical curvature-driven mechanism in vegetated runs.},

abstract = {A minimal Lagrangian two-phase model to study turbulent bedload transport focus- ing on the granular phase is presented and validated with experiments. The model intends to describe bedload transport of massive particles in fully rough flows at relatively low Shields numbers, for which no suspension occurs. A discrete element method for the granular phase is coupled with a one dimensional volume-averaged two-phasemomentum equation for the fluid phase. The coupling between the discrete granular phase and the continuous fluid phase is discussed, and a consistent averaging formulation adapted to bedload transport is introduced. An original simple discrete random walk model is proposed to account for the fluid velocity fluctuations. The model is compared with experiments considering both classical sediment transport rate as a function of the Shields number, and depth profiles of solid velocity, volume fraction, and transport rate density, from existing bedload transport experiments in inclined flume. The results successfully reproduce the classical 3/2 power law, and more importantly describe well the depth profiles of the granular phase, showing that the model is able to reproduce the particle scale mechanisms. From a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the fluctuation model allows to reproduce a realistic critical Shields number, and that the influence of the granular parameters on the macroscopic results is weak. Nevertheless, the analysis of the corresponding depth profiles reveals an evolution of the depth structure of the granular phase with varying restitution and friction coefficients, which denotes the non-trivial underlying physical mechanisms.},

abstract = {Bedload transport generally depends on the bed shear stress and Reynolds number. Many studies conducted for the condition of turbulent flows have revealed the dependence of the transport rate on the bed shear stress, while knowledge of the Reynolds number effect on the transport rate is very limited. As an extreme case to reflect the viscous effect on sediment transport, sediment transport in laminar flows is considered in this paper. A stochastic approach is adopted to explore how the transport rate can be associated with characteristics of laminar flows. First, the probability of erosion in the absence of turbulence is assumed to depend only on the randomness of bed particles. The probability is then applied to formulate the sediment transport rate, of which the derivation is made largely based on Einstein's bedload theory. The theoretical result indicates that the dimensionless transport rate for laminar flows is dependent on the dimensionless shear stress and dimensionless particle diameter or the shear Reynolds number. Comparisons are finally made between the derived formula and an empirical correlation available in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We have validated through laboratory experiments and analytical formulation of the problem a criterion based upon the impulse imparted to a sediment grain. We demonstrate that in addition to the magnitude of the instantaneous turbulent forces applied on a sediment grain, the duration of these turbulent forces is also important in determining the sediment grain's threshold of motion, and that their product, or impulse, is better suited for specifying such conditions.},

The frequency dependence of 0{\{}co) is determined by the Fourier transform of the zeroth and second spatial moments of the function P(s, t), which is equal to the probability per unit time that the displacement and time between hops is s, t. The conductivity corresponding to characteristically different types of hopping distributions is discussed, as vrell as the basic approximation in adopting a CTRW on a lattice to transport in disordered solids.{\}}{\}}{\}}},

abstract = {Although numerous guides exist for building theory, these do not provide much help in carefully gathering material from past research that can serve as material for new theory development. Moreover, although there are numerous guides for conducting literature reviews, none focuses squarely on theory development. We fill this dual shortage by identifying and describing theory-mining reviews, literature reviews that explicitly extract and synthesize the elements of theory from primary studies. Our citation analysis finds that such reviews in information systems have been more highly cited than other kinds of reviews, whether authored by senior or by junior scholars. We present detailed guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review (also known as a systematic review) that develops three different kinds of theory-mining reviews: scoping out a theoretical landscape, contending for a new theoretical model, or rigorously testing a proposed theory. These guidelines are particularly tailored for information systems research, but are sufficiently general to be readily applicable in a wide range of social sciences, so that researchers can stand on the shoulders of foregoing scholarly giants to see farther with new, insightful theories.},

abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of the origin and function of armouring in gravel-bed rivers have not addressed the role of non-uniformity and unsteadiness of flow. These flow attributes have important influences on both the surface and subsurface bed material size distributions which are observed at low flow, from which we commonly make inferences concerning bedload transport at high flow. Bed armouring, measured as the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material grain size, is highly variable spatially in a channel in which past and present bed aggradation indicates that the sediment supply has exceeded the transport capacity. Alternate bar topography induces strong variations in boundary shear stress, especially at low flow. The resulting winnowing of fine sediment from zones of high stress, such as riffles, and its deposition as thin sheets in zones of low stress, such as pools, produce wide variations in armouring. Linked winnowing and deposition of fine sediment in each bar pool sequence creates pronounced, local, streamwise sorting by grain size. Streamwise sorting can lead to pronounced apparent size-selectivity in bedload transport during subsequent rising stages. The relatively fine bedload transported during initial rising stages can originate from unarmoured deposits of fines, where all particle sizes present on the bed surface may be nearly equally mobile. These surfaces are devoid of larger particles, however, that appear in the bedload only when coarser armoured surfaces become more widely entrained. 13.1},

abstract = {The versatility of renewal theory is owed to its abstract formulation. Renewals can be interpreted as steps of a random walk, switching events in two-state models, domain crossings of a random motion, etc. We here discuss a renewal process in which successive events are separated by scale-free waiting time periods. Among other ubiquitous long time properties, this process exhibits aging: events counted initially in a time interval [0,t] statistically strongly differ from those observed at later times [t{\_}a,t{\_}a+t]. In complex, disordered media, processes with scale-free waiting times play a particularly prominent role. We set up a unified analytical foundation for such anomalous dynamics by discussing in detail the distribution of the aging renewal process. We analyze its half-discrete, half-continuous nature and study its aging time evolution. These results are readily used to discuss a scale-free anomalous diffusion process, the continuous time random walk. By this we not only shed light on the profound origins of its characteristic features, such as weak ergodicity breaking. Along the way, we also add an extended discussion on aging effects. In particular, we find that the aging behavior of time and ensemble averages is conceptually very distinct, but their time scaling is identical at high ages. Finally, we show how more complex motion models are readily constructed on the basis of aging renewal dynamics.},

In order to effectively simulate this important problem avoiding exces- sive computational costs, we followed a decoupled approach, which uses a computed turbulent velocity field for a smooth flat plate as a surrogate of the three-dimensional (3D) turbulent conditions close to the bed in streams. Because these two flows are not the same, we first tested that the basic turbulence statistics for this velocity field did not differ significantly from those in an open-channel flow. We then tracked particles with a 3D Lagrangian model. The Lagrangian model also includes the calculation of the particle rotation and a generalized algorithm for particle collisions with walls and with other par- ticles. Numerical simulations of several particle sizes were performed and the results were compared with previous experimental data, with good agreement.},

In an effort to frame a more inclusive paradigm for river management, we discuss sediment inputs, transport, and storage within river systems; interactions among water, sediment, and valley context; and the need to broaden the natural flow regime concept. Explicitly incorporating sediment is challenging, because sediment is supplied, transported, and stored by nonlinear and episodic processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales than water and because sediment regimes have been highly altered by humans. Nevertheless, managing for a desired balance between sediment supply and transport capacity is not only tractable, given current geomorphic process knowledge, but also essential because of the importance of sediment regimes to aquatic and riparian ecosystems, the physical template of which depends on sediment-driven river structure and function.},

It was shown in a companion paper [$\backslash$n                              $\backslash$n      Seminara et al., 2002$\backslash$n                              ], however, that the Bagnold hypothesis breaks down when applied to equilibrium bed load transport on beds with transverse$\backslash$n                              slopes above a relatively modest value that is well below the angle of repose. An investigation of this failure resulted in$\backslash$n                              a demonstration of its lack of validity even for nearly horizontal beds. The constraint is here replaced with an entrainment$\backslash$n                              formulation, according to which a dynamic equilibrium is maintained by a balance between entrainment of bed grains into the$\backslash$n                              bed load layer and deposition of bed load grains onto the bed. The entrainment function is formulated so that the entrainment$\backslash$n                              rate is an increasing function of the excess of the fluid shear stress at the bed over the threshold value. The formulation$\backslash$n                              is implemented with the aid of a unique set of laboratory data that characterizes equilibrium bed load transport at relatively$\backslash$n                              low shear stresses for streamwise angles of bed inclination varying from nearly 0° to 22°. The formulation is shown to provide$\backslash$n                              a description of bed load transport on nearly horizontal beds that fits the data as well as that resulting from the Bagnold$\backslash$n                              constraint. The entrainment formulation has the added advantage of not requiring the unrealistically high dynamic coefficient$\backslash$n                              of Coulomb friction resulting from the Bagnold constraint. Finally, the entrainment formulation provides reasonable and consistent$\backslash$n                              results on finite streamwise and transverse bed slopes, even those at which the Bagnold formulation breaks down completely.},

abstract = {The problem of determining the threshold of motion of a sediment particle resting on the bed of an open channel has historically been dominated by an approach based on the time-space-averaged bed shear stress (i.e. Shields criterion). Recently, experimental studies have promoted an alternative approach to predict the dislodgement threshold, which is based on the impulse of the flow-induced force. Nonetheless, theoretical analyses accompanying these studies result in complex expressions that fail to provide a direct estimate of said impulse threshold. We employ the work-energy principle to derive a prediction of the fundamental impulse threshold that the destabilising hydrodynamic force must overcome in order to achieve full particle dislodgement. For the bed configuration studied, which is composed of spheres, the proposed expression depends on the mobile particle's size and mass, and shows excellent agreement with experimental observations previously published. The derivation presented in this paper may thus represent a robust theoretical framework that aids in the re-interpretation of existing data, as well as in the design of future experiments aimed at analysing the importance of hydrodynamic impulse as criterion for prediction of particle dislodgement.},

In this regime, the bulk packing fraction (away from the top free surface and the bottom plate boundary) remains constant as a function of depth z, of the pile. The velocity profile in the direction of flow v(z) scales with height of the pile H, according to v(z) proportional to H{\^{}}a, with a=1.52.

abstract = {To compute any physical quantity for a random particle, one needs to know the mathematical shape of the particle. For regular particles like spheres and ellipsoids, the mathematics are straightforward. For random particles, with realistic shapes, mathematically characterizing the shape had not been generally done. But since about the year 2002, a method has been developed that combines X-ray computed tomography and spherical harmonic analysis to give analytical, differentiable mathematical functions for the three-dimensional shape of star-shape particles, which are a wide class of particles covering most industrial particles of interest, ranging from micrometer scale to millimeter scale particles. This review article describes how this is done, in some detail, and then gives examples of applications of this method, including a contact function that is suitable for these random shape particles. The purpose of this article is to make these ideas widely available for the general powder researcher who knows that particle shape is important to his/her applications, and especially for those researchers who are just starting out in their particle science and technology careers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018. American Geophysical Union. Sediment particles transported as bed load undergo alternating periods of motion and rest, particularly at weak flow intensity. Bed load transport can be investigated by either following the motion of individual particles (Lagrangian approach) or observing the phenomenon at prescribed locations (Eulerian approach). In this paper, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions are merged into a unifying framework that includes definitions for quantities used to describe the kinematics of particle motion, as well as the relationships among these quantities. The alternation of motion and rest is represented by two complementary descriptions: (i) proportion of motion, indicating either the relative time spent in motion by an individual particle or the relative number of moving particles; (ii) persistence of motion, indicating the extent to which the process consists of relatively few long periods of motion or of many short ones. The framework only involves first moments of the key quantities. The conceptual developments are tested against results from an experiment with weak bed load transport, demonstrating the soundness of the approach. From an operational point of view, a Lagrangian observation is difficult to perform, since the particle motion is usually investigated for finite spatial domains (e.g., a measurement window within a laboratory or natural reach). Strategies to overcome such limitations are described, suggesting the possibility of obtaining unbiased mean values for Lagrangian descriptors. The proposed framework can be used in any study aimed at parameterizing the kinematic properties of bed load particles as functions of the hydrodynamic conditions.},

Two water recirculating sediment feed flumes were used: one with a 6 m long and 0.15 m wide channel and other with an 11 m long channel with widths of 0.74 m and 0.53 m. The sediment, poorly sorted gravel with a mean size of 3 mm, was fed at the upstream end of the channel at steady rates from 0.03 kg s{\&}{\#}8722;1 m{\&}{\#}8722;1 to 1.0 kg s{\&}{\#}8722;1 m{\&}{\#}8722;1. Sediment transport rate out of the channel varied in all runs, at approximate periods of 3 min in the runs with high transport rates to 14 min in the runs with low transport rates. The runs with low transport rates also showed fluctuations in total transport rate at periods of about 25 min. Transport rates of each size fraction varied with time in a distinctive pattern in all runs. The time variations were caused by the migration of very long and low bed load sheets in the runs with low to moderate transport rates and dunelike bed forms in the run with the highest transport rate. The bed surface in all runs was coarser in size than the original sediment mix except that with the highest transport rate (run H5) in which the size distribution was nearly the same as the original.},

abstract = {Temporary storage of sediment within alluvial valley floors modulates the long-term transport of sediment through landscapes. The fate of weathering minerals or sediment-bound constituents in fluvial environments depends on the relative time scales of constituent degradation and particle residence time within valleys. Particles follow a set of trajectories through valley floors: some particles pass directly through the channel, reaching the basin outlet rapidly after being introduced to the fluvial system; others remain for long periods in deposits such as flood plains. Traditional sediment routing theory, based on the principle of sediment mass conservation along reaches of channel, does not account for exchanges of sediment with temporary sediment storage reservoirs outside the channel, such as flood plains, deltas, and alluvial fans. This article formalizes a theory that incorporates the role of such exchanges in the migration of sediment through river systems, by computing the probabilistic structure of particle trajectories through alluvial valley floors. Equations are developed for computing these trajectories from the sediment budget of a valley floor in steady state. Mathematical strategies for using such relationships to model transient storage conditions are proposed, and other potential model enhancements are discussed. The approach is illustrated using a hypothetical valley floor as an example. The theory can be used to examine rates of sediment overturn in valleys, map particle residence times, and account for the redistribution and decomposition of weathering minerals and particle-bound constituents. The theory has numerous potential management applications, some of which are discussed herein. The hypothetical example demonstrates that the probability distribution of particle residence times in the valleys of most alluvial rivers should be strongly right skewed.

abstract = {Sediment storage in alluvial valleys can strongly modulate the downstream migration of sediment and associated contaminants through landscapes. Traditional methods for routing contaminated sediment through valleys focus on in-channel sediment transport but ignore the influence of sediment exchanges with temporary sediment storage reservoirs outside the channel, such as floodplains. In theory, probabilistic analysis of particle trajectories through valleys offers a useful strategy for quantifying the influence of sediment storage on the downstream movement of contaminated sediment. This paper describes a field application and test of this theory, using 137Cs as a sediment tracer over 45 years (1952-1997), downstream of a historical effluent outfall at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), New Mexico. The theory is parameterized using a sediment budget based on field data and an estimate of the 137Cs release history at the upstream boundary. The uncalibrated model reasonably replicates the approximate magnitude and spatial distribution of channel- and floodplain-stored 137Cs measured in an independent field study. Model runs quantify the role of sediment storage in the long-term migration of a pulse of contaminated sediment, quantify the downstream impact of upstream mitigation, and mathematically decompose the future 137Cs flux near the LANL property boundary to evaluate the relative contributions of various upstream contaminant sources. The fate of many sediment-bound contaminants is determined by the relative timescales of contaminant degradation and particle residence time in different types of sedimentary environments. The theory provides a viable approach for quantifying the long-term movement of contaminated sediment through valleys. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Bedload transport is known to be a highly fluctuating temporal phenomenon, even under constant (mean) flow conditions, as a consequence of stochasticity, bedform migration, grain sorting, hysteresis, or sediment supply limitation. Because bedload transport formulas usually refer to a single mean transport value for a given flow condition, one can expect that prediction accuracy (when compared to measurements) will depend on the amplitude and duration of fluctuations, which in turn depend on the time scale used for observations. This paper aims to identify how the time scale considered can affect bedload prediction. This was done by testing 16 common bedload transport formulas with four data sets corresponding to different measurement period durations: (i) highly fluctuating (quasi-)instantaneous field measurements; (ii) volumes accumulated at the event scale on two small alpine gravel-bed rivers, potentially affected by seasonal fluctuations; (iii) volumes accumulated at the interannual scale in a meandering gravel bed river, thought to be weakly subject to fluctuations; (iv) time-integrated flume measurements with nearly uniform sediments. The tests confirmed that the longer the measurement period, the better the precision of the formula's prediction interval. They also demonstrate several consequential limitations. Most threshold formulas are no longer valid when the flow condition is below two times the threshold condition for the largest elements' motion on the bed surface (considering D84). In such conditions, equations either predict zero transport, or largely overestimate the real transport, especially when D84 is high. There is a need for new sediment data collected with highly reliable techniques such as recording slot bedload samplers to further investigate this topic.

Over the past few decades sophisticated experiments and data collection in numerous biological, physical and financial systems have revealed anomalous sub-diffusion in which the mean square displacement grows slower than linearly with time. A major theoretical challenge has been to derive the appropriate evolution equation for the probability density function of sub-diffusion taking into account further complications from force fields and reactions. Here we present a derivation of the generalised master equation for an ensemble of particles undergoing reactions whilst being subject to an external force field. From this general equation we show reductions to a range of well known special cases, including the fractional reaction diffusion equation and the fractional Fokker-Planck equation.},

abstract = {A longstanding problem in the study of sediment transport in gravel-bed rivers is related to the physical mechanisms governing bed resistance and particle motion. To study this problem, we investigated the motion of coarse spherical glass beads entrained by a steady shallow turbulent water flow down a steep two-dimensional channel with a mobile bed. This experimental facility is the simplest representation of sediment transport on the laboratory scale, with the tremendous advantages that boundary conditions are perfectly controlled and a wealth of information can be obtained using imaging techniques. Flows were filmed from the side by a high-speed camera. Using image processing software made it possible to determine the flow characteristics such as particle trajectories, their state of motion (rest, rolling, or saltating motion), and flow depth. In accordance with earlier investigations, we observed that over short time periods, sediment transport appeared as a very intermittent process. To interpret these results, we revisited Einstein's theory on sediment and derived the statistical properties (probability distribution and autocorrelation function) of the key variables such as the solid discharge and the number of moving particles. Analyzing the autocorrelation functions and the probability distributions of our measurements revealed the existence of long-range correlations. For instance, whereas theory predicts a Binomial distribution for the number of moving particles, experiments demonstrated that a negative binomial distribution best fit our data, which emphasized the crucial role played by wide fluctuations. These frequent wide fluctuations stemmed particle entrainment and motion being collective phenomena rather than individual processes, contrary to what is assumed in most theoretical models.},

abstract = {[1] Fluvial sediment transport is caused by a complex interaction of interdependent grain and fluid processes many of which are stochastic in nature and cannot be adequately represented by deterministic equations. Random variable analysis has been used previously but limited data are available to describe the variability of grain resistance combined with particle arrangements, and thus validate such analysis. In this study low to medium bed load transport tests were carried out in a flume where sediment movement was monitored using a three-camera 3D PIV system. Simultaneous grain motion and flow velocity measurements were made on a plane located slightly above and parallel to the sediment bed. Detailed statistical velocity information was acquired to model the velocity distribution at the bed level. This was combined with the joint probabilistic distribution of particle exposures and grain resistance to motion, which were obtained from discrete particle modeling (DPM) simulations. DPM simulations were used to provide a stochastic mathematical description of the risk that a stationary particle is entrained by the flow. Predictions from the stochastic model equations replicated the observed pulsation in sediment transport. This demonstrates that it is possible to simulate sediment entrainment and transport at a high resolution by adequately modeling all the sub-processes. A number of flow patterns were identified that caused large fluctuations of the entrainment rate. These all exhibit high velocity flow structures, but they selectively cause the dislodgement of individual particles located at different positions. This selective behavior follows from the variability of the interaction between the near-bed flow and the particles having different exposure.},

abstract = {At the smallest scales of sediment transport in rivers, the coherent structures of the turbulent boundary layer constitute the fundamental mechanisms of bedload transport, locally increasing the instantaneous hydrodynamic forces acting on sediment particles, and mobilizing them downstream. Near the critical threshold for initiating sediment motion, the interactions of the particles with these unsteady coherent structures and with other sedi-ment grains, produce localized transport events with brief episodes of collective motion occurring due to the near-bed velocity fluctuations. Simulations of these flows pose a significant challenge for numerical models aimed at capturing the physical processes and complex non-linear interactions that generate highly intermittent and self-similar bedload transport fluxes. In this investigation we carry out direct numerical simulations of the flow in a rectangular flat-bed channel, at a Reynolds number equal to Re = 3632, coupled with the discrete element method to simulate the dynamics of spherical particles near the bed. We perform two-way coupled Lagrangian simulations of 48,510 sediment particles, with 4851 fixed particles to account for bed roughness. Our simulations consider a total of eight different values of the non-dimensional Shields parameter to study the evolution of transport statistics. From the trajectory and velocity of each sediment particle, we compute the changes in the probability distribution functions of velocities, bed activity, and jump lengths as the Shields number increases. For the lower shear stresses, the intermittency of the global bedload transport flux is described by computing the singularity or multifr actal spectrum of transport, which also characterizes the widespread range of transport event magnitudes. These findings can help to identify the mechanisms of sediment transport at the particle scale. The statistical analysis can also be used as an ingredient to develop larger, upscaled models for predicting mean transport rates, considering the variability of entrainment and deposition that characterizes the transport near the threshold of motion.},

abstract = {This study explores the hypothesis that the relative frequency of rock exposure in the bed of an incising channel can have a first-order impact on the long-term average erosion rate. The 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in central Taiwan generated thousands of landslides along the middle reach of the Peikang River. Sediment from these landslides produced widespread aggradation, such that much of the river's bed remains shielded from active bedrock incision. We present data that constrain the spatial and temporal variability of sediment cover for the Peikang River. Because the river is undergoing spatially variable Holocene bedrock incision (1-10 mm/yr), it offers a unique natural experiment to test the influence of intermittent sedimentation on long-term incision rates. Published electrical resistivity surveys at seven locations along the river reveal median sediment depth values ranging from 1.9 to 11.5 m. The sediment depth correlates inversely with long-term incision rate and sediment transport capacity. We interpret this as an indication that the frequency of bedrock exposure exerts a major influence on incision along the Peikang River.

abstract = {Single-molecule spectroscopy can monitor transitions between two microscopic states when these transitions are associated with the emission of photons. A general formalism is developed for obtaining the statistics of such transitions from a microscopic model when the dynamics is described by master or rate equations or their continuum analog, multidimensional reaction-diffusion equations. The focus is on the distribution of the number of transitions during a fixed observation time, the distribution of times between transitions, and the corresponding correlation functions. It is shown how these quantities are related to each other and how they can be explicitly calculated in a straightforward way for both immobile and diffusing molecules. Our formalism reduces to renewal theory when the monitored transitions either go to or originate from a single state. The influence of dynamics slow compared with the time between monitored transitions is treated in a simple way, and the probability distributions are expressed in terms of Mandel-type formulas. The formalism is illustrated by a detailed analysis of the statistics of catalytic turnovers of enzymes. When the rates of conformational changes are slower than the catalytic rates which are in turn slower than the binding relaxation rate, (1) the mean number of turnovers is shown to have the classical Michaelis-Menten form, (2) the correlation function of the number of turnovers is a direct measure of the time scale of catalytic rate fluctuations, and (3) the distribution of the time between consecutive turnovers is determined by the steady-state distribution.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to implement a random death process into a persistent random walk model which produces sub-ballistic superdiffusion (L{\'{e}}vy walk). We develop a stochastic two-velocity jump model of cell motility for which the switching rate depends upon the time which the cell has spent moving in one direction. It is assumed that the switching rate is a decreasing function of residence (running) time. This assumption leads to the power law for the velocity switching time distribution. This describes the anomalous persistence of cell motility: the longer the cell moves in one direction, the smaller the switching probability to another direction becomes. We derive master equations for the cell densities with the generalized switching terms involving the tempered fractional material derivatives. We show that the random death of cells has an important implication for the transport process through tempering of the superdiffusive process. In the long-time limit we write stationary master equations in terms of exponentially truncated fractional derivatives in which the rate of death plays the role of tempering of a L{\'{e}}vy jump distribution. We find the upper and lower bounds for the stationary profiles corresponding to the ballistic transport and diffusion with the death-rate-dependent diffusion coefficient. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these bounds.},

abstract = {[1] Particles transported as bed load within a specified streambed area possess a distribution of velocities. This distribution figures prominently in describing the rate of sediment transport and the rate of dispersal of particles during transport. We provide a probabilistic derivation of the distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities under uniform, quasi-steady transport conditions. The formulation centers on defining the ensemble of microstates of particle momenta (the set of possible ways to partition a fixed number of particles into momentum states) subject to the constraint that the sum of the particle momenta in each microstate is fixed, a constraint that is imposed by conditions of equilibrium transport. From this, we obtain the most probable distribution of momentum states, assuming each microstate within the ensemble is equally probable. The analysis suggests that, for small particle numbers, the distribution of velocities is exponential-like but decays faster than an exponential function. For large particle numbers, the distribution is exponential. These distributions are consistent with experimental results from high-speed imaging of sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed, which reveal that the probability distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like. These particle velocity distributions also emerge from numerical analyses involving large eddy simulations of turbulent fluid motions and a discrete element method describing particle motions, wherein the large eddy simulations and discrete element method models are fully coupled in momentum.},

The densest packings are of great interest in pure mathematics, including discrete geometry and number theory. This perspective reviews pertinent theoretical and computational literature concerning the equilibrium, metastable and nonequilibrium packings of hard-particle packings in various Euclidean space dimensions. In the case of jammed packings, emphasis will be placed on the "geometric-structure" approach, which provides a powerful and unified means to quantitatively characterize individual packings via jamming categories and "order" maps. It incorporates extremal jammed states, including the densest packings, maximally random jammed states, and lowest-density jammed structures. Packings of identical spheres, spheres with a size distribution, and nonspherical particles are also surveyed. We close this review by identifying challenges and open questions for future research.},

We combine the theory of random fields for spherical topology with a Fourier-shape-descriptor based method for the particle generation, and develop rigorous solutions to resolve the mathematical difficulties arising from the linking of the two. The generated particles are then packed within a prescribed container by a cell-filling algorithm based on Constrained Voronoi Tessellation. We employ two examples to demonstrate the excellent control and flexibility that the proposed method can offer in reproducing such key characteristics as shape descriptors (aspect ratio, roundness, sphericity, presence of facets, etc.), size distribution and solid fraction. The study provides a general and robust framework on effective characterization and packing of granular particles with complex shapes for discrete modelling of granular media.},

abstract = {A sediment particle traversing the fluvial system may spend the majority of the total transit time at rest, stored in various sedimentary deposits. Floodplains are among the most important of these deposits, with the potential to store large amounts of sediment for long periods of time. The virtual velocity of a sediment grain depends strongly on the amount of time spent in storage, but little is known about sediment storage times. Measurements of floodplain vegetation age have suggested that storage times are exponentially distributed, a case that arises when all the sediment on a floodplain is equally vulnerable to erosion in a given interval. This assumption has been incorporated into sediment routing models, despite some evidence that younger sediment is more likely to be eroded from floodplains than older sediment. We investigate the relationship between sediment age and erosion, which we term the erosion hazard, with a model of a meandering river that constructs its floodplain by lateral accretion. We find that the erosion hazard decreases with sediment age, leading to a storage time distribution that is not exponential. We propose an alternate model that requires that channel motion is approximately diffusive and results in a heavy tailed distribution of storage time. The model applies to timescales over which the direction of channel motion is uncorrelated. We speculate that the lower end of this range of time is set by the meander cutoff timescale and the upper end is set by processes that limit the width of the meander belt.},

abstract = {In many gravel-bedded rivers, floods that fill the channel banks create just enough shear stress to move the median-sized gravel particles on the bed surface (D50). Because this observation is common and is supported by theory, the coincidence of bankfull flow and the incipient motion of D50 has become a commonly used assumption. However, not all natural gravel channels actually conform to this simple relationship; some channels maintain bankfull stresses far in excess of the critical stress required to initiate sediment transport. We use a database of {\textgreater}300 gravel-bedded rivers and {\textgreater}600 10Be-derived erosion rates from across North America to explore the hypothesis that sediment supply drives the magnitude of bankfull shear stress relative to the critical stress required to mobilize the median bed surface grain size ($\tau$bf*/$\tau$c*). We find that $\tau$bf*/$\tau$c* is significantly higher in West Coast river reaches (2.35, n = 96) than in river reaches elsewhere on the continent (1.03, n = 245). This pattern parallels patterns in erosion rates (and hence sediment supplies). Supporting our hypothesis, we find a significant correlation between upstream erosion rate and local $\tau$bf*/$\tau$c* at sites where this comparison is possible. Our analysis reveals a decrease in bed surface armoring with increasing $\tau$bf*/$\tau$c*, suggesting channels accommodate changes in sediment supply through adjustments in bed surface grain size, as also shown through numerical modeling. Our findings demonstrate that sediment supply is encoded in the bankfull hydraulic geometry of gravel bedded channels through its control on bed surface grain size. },

abstract = {The transport of dense particles by a turbulent flow depends on two dimensionless numbers. Depending on the ratio of the shear velocity of the flow to the settling velocity of the particles (or the Rouse number), sediment transport takes place in a thin layer localized at the surface of the sediment bed (bedload) or over the whole water depth (suspended load). Moreover, depending on the sedimentation Reynolds number, the bedload layer is embedded in the viscous sublayer or is larger. We propose here a two-phase flow model able to describe both viscous and turbulent shear flows. Particle migration is described as resulting from normal stresses, but is limited by turbulent mixing and shear-induced diffusion of particles. Using this framework, we theoretically investigate the transition between bedload and suspended load.},

For processes driven by thermal equilibrium noise, the fluctuation-dissipation relation holds. In consequence, the system has to be described by a generalized (integro-differential) Langevin equation with a restriction on the damping integral kernel: Its form depends on the correlation function of noise. For processes driven by nonequilibrium noise, there is no such a restriction: They are considered to be described by stochastic differential (Ito- or Langevin-type) equations with an independent noise term. For the latter, we review methods of analysis of one-dimensional systems driven by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.},

abstract = {The presence of sediment cover in bedrock rivers inhibits saltation-driven incision, and so accurate predictions of the relationship between bedrock exposure (Fe) and relative sediment flux (sediment supply rate over capacity sediment transport rate, Qs/Qt) are necessary to model incision and hence landscape evolution. Theoretical predictions of a linear or negative exponential form for this relationship are not consistent with laboratory data that instead demonstrate a range of different relationships. Here we use a cellular automaton (CA) model to establish how the relationship between Fe and Qs/Qt evolves from the dynamics of, and interactions between, individual sediment grains moving through a bedrock channel. The key model parameter is the probability of grain entrainment, which is altered as a function of the number of neighboring grains in order to reproduce the enhanced mobility of isolated grains on bedrock surfaces. For each model run, an equilibrium sediment cover is attained for a specified sediment input, enabling the relationship between Fe and Qs/Qt to be established. As well as both linear and exponential relationships, model runs reproduce other relationships observed in laboratory experiments. These other relationships require isolated grains to be more easily entrained than grains in sediment clusters, which is consistent with field observations of grain mobility. There is therefore a continuum of relationships between Fe and Qs/Qt; the relationship that is most applicable to a particular reach will depend on the role of channel slope, roughness and shear stress in controlling the entrainment of grains from bedrock and alluvial surfaces.},

abstract = {1 We introduce a new conceptual model for longitudinal and transverse diffusion of moving bed particles under weak bed load transport. For both rolling/sliding and saltating modes the model suggests that the particle motion is diffusive and comprises at least three ranges of temporal and spatial scales with different diffusion regimes: (1) the local range (ballistic diffusion), (2) the intermediate range (normal or anomalous diffusion), and (3) the global range (subdiffusion). The local range corresponds to ballistic particle trajectories between two successive collisions with the static bed particles. The intermediate range corresponds to particle trajectories between two successive periods of rest. These trajectories consist of many local trajectories and may include tens or hundreds of collisions with the bed. The global range of scales corresponds to particle trajectories consisting of many intermediate trajectories, just as intermediate trajectories consist of many local trajectories. Our data from the Balmoral Canal (the intermediate range) and Drake et al.'s 1988 data from the Duck Creek (the global range) provide strong support for this conceptual model and identify anomalous diffusion regimes for the intermediate range (superdiffusion) and the global range (subdiffusion).},

Values of U,c for such overriding grains are substantially less than normally accepted values. The sediment transport rate equation predicts plane bed experimental data well, over five orders of magnitude of i•,.

@article{Barry2010,
abstract = {Hairsine and Rose developed a mechanistic, one-dimensional, precipitation-driven erosion model that, since its appearance, has been validated by several sets of experimental results. The model allows any sediment particle to be present in one of three zones, viz., the flow zone, the deposited layer, or the original soil. The model has the general form of a two-region model, in which advection is the only transport process. For the special case of a soil composed of a single particle size and for overland flow that occurs at a steady rate and with a uniform depth, it is possible to derive fully explicit analytical solutions to the model. Details of the solutions for a slightly generalized mathematical form of the model are provided. The Goldstein J function, which appears commonly in two-region model solutions, was modified to accommodate some of the solutions presented. The form of the model analyzed indicated that, based only on sediment concentrations in runoff water, it is not possible to distinguish one mechanistic feature of the Hairsine-Rose model, i.e., that raindrop-induced detachment of the undisturbed soil moves directly into the flowing water. From the point of view of the model, it is equally plausible for raindrop impact to move sediment directly into the deposited layer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Contradicting the classic view that {\$}\kappa{\$} should be universal in open-channel flows of clear water with a fully developed boundary layer, irrespectively of the type of boundary, it has recently been proposed that the value of {\$}\kappa{\$} is influenced by the mobility of the bottom boundary.Rather than advocating a particular view on the nature of {\$}\kappa{\$}, the objectives of this work are: (i) to provide a similarity framework for the nature of {\$}\kappa{\$}, highlighting, in the process, the underlying key phenomena at play, and (ii) to explore a theoretical model for {\$}\kappa{\$} as a function of turbulence parameters.Dimensional analysis is performed, including a new key step, following the works of Selim Yalin, in which the shear-rate is interpreted as a two-phase variable, depending on flow as well as sediment parameters. Vaschy-Buckingham's theorem is applied and similarity arguments leading to the log-law are employed. These introduce appropriate hypothesis concerning complete and incomplete similarity, thus providing a theoretical framework for the discussion of the nature of {\$}\kappa{\$}. A theoretical model is then explored, materialised in a functional relation between {\$}\kappa{\$} and turbulence parameters. The discussion of the nature of {\$}\kappa{\$} becomes a discussion of the nature of those parameters, all susceptible to be measured. Such discussion is based on laboratory results concerning flows over porous immobile and mobile beds. The data reveals changes in the structure of turbulence for flows over weakly mobile gravel-sand beds but is not supportive of a reduction of the value of {\$}\kappa{\$}.},

abstract = {1 The relation between equilibrium stream channel morphology and three independent governing variables, discharge, sediment supply, and valley slope, is investigated using a stream table. The experiments are based on a generic physical model of a laterally active gravel bed stream and directed by a recently published rational regime model. While a variety of channel adjustments are possible, the primary adjustment observed was in the channel slope. Other adjustments, such as surface armor composition and cross-sectional shape, were minor in comparison. The equilibrium slope is well predicted by a linear function of sediment concentration which is bounded by two thresholds: one associated with the minimum stream power necessary to deform the bed and the other associated with the maximum sediment feed that can be transported by the available flow. The results suggest that the system tends to move toward the minimum slope capable of transporting the sediment supply, in the process increasing the flow resistance for the system. Whether or not a minimum slope or a maximum system-scale flow resistance is reached cannot be determined given the available data, but there appears to be a unique slope or, at least, a limited range of slopes) for which a stable alluvial channel morphology can be established for a given sediment concentration. The implications of this behavior are evaluated for the theoretical basis of the extremal hypothesis used to close the formulation of a rational regime model.},

The suspended load transport rates of individual fractions were mea- sured and compared with both Einstein's and Holtroff's methods of calculation of suspended load for individual fractions. These methods were found to be unsatisfactory in the present range of sediment parameters. A relationship is found to exist between the dimensionless shear stress and the suspended trans- port rate for uniform sediment. To make this relation applicable to nonuniform sediments, a corrective multiplying factor for shear stress is introduced. The dimensionless parameters which govern this correction factor are identified and a relation for the same obtained. In this manner the relation can be applied to individual size portions of a sediment mixture.},

abstract = {A geomorphic transport law is a mathematical statement derived from a physical principle or mechanism, which expresses the mass flux or erosion caused by one or more processes in a manner that: 1) can be parameterized from field measurements, 2) can be tested in physical models, and 3) can be applied over geomorphically significant spatial and temporal scales. Such laws are a compromise between physics-based theory that requires extensive information about materials and their interactions, which may be hard to quantify across real landscapes, and rules-based approaches, which cannot be tested directly but only can be used in models to see if the model outcomes match some expected or observed state. We propose that landscape evolution modeling can be broadly categorized into detailed, apparent, statistical and essential realism models and it is the latter, concerned with explaining mechanistically the essential morphodynamic features of a landscape, in which geomorphic transport laws are most effectively applied. A limited number of studies have provided verification and parameterization of geomorphic transport laws for: linear slope-dependent transport, non-linear transport due to dilational disturbance of soil, soil production from bedrock, and river incision into bedrock. Field parameterized geomorphic transport laws, however, are lacking for many processes including landslides, debris flows, surface wash, and glacial scour. We propose the use of high- resolution topography, as initial conditions, in landscape evolution models and explore the applicability of locally parameterized geomorphic transport laws in explaining hillslope morphology in the Oregon Coast Range. This modeling reveals unexpected morphodynamics, suggesting that the use of real landscapes with geomorphic transport laws may provide new insights about the linkages between process and form.},

The model is used to compute the saltation heights and lengths for a range of flow conditions. The computational results are used to determine simple relationships for the saltation characteristics. Measured transport rates of the bed load are used to compute the sediment concentration in the bed‐load layer. A simple expression specifying the bed‐load concentration as a function of the flow and sediment conditions is proposed.

abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

abstract = {This article examines the spatial dynamics of bed load particles in water. We focus particularly on the fluctuations of particle activity, which is defined as the number of moving particles per unit bed length. Based on a stochastic model recently proposed by Ancey and Heyman (2014), we derive the second moment of particle activity analytically, that is, the spatial correlation functions of particle activity. From these expressions, we show that large moving particle clusters can develop spatially. Also, we provide evidence that fluctuations of particle activity are scale dependent. Two characteristic lengths emerge from the model: a saturation length ..sat describing the length needed for a perturbation in particle activity to relax to the homogeneous solution and a correlation length ..c describing the typical size of moving particle clusters. A dimensionless Peclet number can also be defined according to the transport model. Three different experimental data sets are used to test the theoretical results. We show that the stochastic model describes spatial patterns of particle activity well at all scales. In particular, we show that ..c and ..sat may be relatively large compared to typical scales encountered in bed load experiments (grain diameter, water depth, bed form wavelength, flume length, etc.) suggesting that the spatial fluctuations of particle activity have a nonnegligible impact on the average transport process.},

@article{McDonald2010,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. American Geophysical Union. Measurement and estimation of bed load transport in gravel bed rivers are highly affected by its temporal fluctuations. Such variability is primarily driven by the flow regime but is also associated with a variety of inherent channel processes, such as flow turbulence, grain entrainment, and bed forms migration. These internal and external controls often act at comparable time scales, and are therefore difficult to disentangle, thus hindering the study of bed load variability under unsteady flow regime. In this paper, we report on laboratory experiments performed in a large, mobile bed flume where typical hydromorphological conditions of gravel bed rivers were reproduced. Data from a large number of replicated runs, including triangular and square-wave hydrographs, were used to build a statistically sound description of sediment transport processes. We found that the inherent variability of bed load flux strongly depends on the sampling interval, and it is significantly higher in complex, wandering or braided channels. This variability can be filtered out by computing the mean response over the experimental replicates, which allows us to highlight two distinctive phenomena: (i) an overshooting (undershooting) response of the mean bed load flux to a sudden increase (decrease) of discharge, and (ii) a clockwise hysteresis in the sediment rating curve. We then provide an interpretation of these findings through a conceptual mathematical model, showing how both phenomena are associated with a lagging morphological adaptation to unsteady flow. Overall, this work provides basic information for evaluating, monitoring, and managing gravel transport in morphologically active rivers.},

@article{Wu2004a,
abstract = {In this study we incorporate the existing concept of fractional mobility into a stochastic framework for modeling the partial transport of mixed-size sediment. The model predicts the fractional transport rates with parameters such as the long-run moving probability, mean particle velocity, and fractional mobility, all varying with the dimensionless effective shear stress. Movement of bed load particles is treated as a random combination of single-step motions described by the pseudo four-state continuous-time Markov process whose long-run moving probability can be evaluated with the instantaneous entrainment probability and ratio of mean single-step holding time. A most updated version of entrainment probability taking into account both the rolling and lifting modes is adopted; the ratio of mean holding time is determined with a physically based relation derived experimentally. Two types of experiments are performed in this study: the colored bed experiments are carried out to observe the fractional mobility and partial transport; the plain bed experiments are conducted to observe the single-step bed load motions and mean particle velocity. The proposed model is widely tested with laboratory and field data pertaining to both partial and full transport conditions, and reasonably good agreement between the predicted and observed results is demonstrated. The model is then applied to evaluate the fractional mobility and explore the influence of sand content. The results reveal that the relation between fractional mobility and dimensionless effective shear stress is well approximated by the cumulative lognormal distribution, with its mean and standard deviation linearly decreasing with sand content for the range {\textless}0.34. The results imply that the existence of fine-grained sand in the gravel-sand mixture is favorable to the mobilization of sediment. At higher sand content the condition of partial transport exists within a narrower range of flows such that full transport is easier to achieve. The present study is the first to investigate the effect of sand content on the fractional mobility, thus providing new insights into the process of partial transport.},

The influence of the maximum degree of SH functions and mesh fineness on the determination of size and shape descriptors of the particles are systematically investigated. Correlations between different shape descriptors of the studied sands are examined. Utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), a probabilistic approach considering both intrinsic and phenomenological correlations between SH coefficients is proposed to three-dimensionally regenerate the sand particles. Based on comprehensive and quantitative comparisons between the morphological characteristics of scanned and generated particles, we conclude that the proposed approach performs satisfactorily.},

Morphological style is determined chiefly by the caliber and quantity of sediment delivered to the channel, although modulated by channel scale. Yet the relations between sediment transport and river morphol-ogy have received only limited, qualitative attention. In this review, the problem is studied by defining sediment transport regimes on the basis of the Shields number, a nondimensional measure of the capacity of the channel to move sediment of a given caliber. The problem is also approached from an inverse perspective by which the quantity and character of sediment deposits are used to infer details about the vari-ation of sediment transport and sedimentation along a channel. Coupling the two approaches establishes a basis to gain new insights into the origins of alluvial channel morphology.},

We give a closed formula for the averaged dynamics and we discuss the physical meaning of the probabilistic elements incorporated.

It was found that even in the case of an extremely high relative roughness, the drag force on the protrusions may be determined from the logarithmic friction laws. A very significant lift force which tends to pull the protrusions away from the wall and into the flow was measured. This lift force was divided into two part: A constant average value and a random fluctuation superimposed over the average. A careful statistical analysis showed that the frequency of diferent pressures or lift forces at the wall follows very accurately the normal error law. This fact seems to indicate that in the description of turbulence near a rough wall, the pressures must, be regarded as the primary influence, not the velocities.},

The sensitivity of the particle friction factor, restitution coefficient, and spring stiffness used in the soft sphere collision model is tested in the three regimes of sediment transport comprising of essentially no motion, bed load, and suspended load flow regimes. The simulations are run for 10 s using base values of the parameters of interest (reference calculation), then one parameter is changed at a time and the corresponding change in quantitative result is observed for the following 15 s where averaged results in the last 10 s are compared to the reference calculation. The sensitivity analysis shows that the underpredicted sediment transport in the suspended load regime can be bridged by moderately decreasing the friction factor of the particles from 0.6 to 0.25. The impact of the same change in bed load regime is not as significant. Both the coefficient of restitution and the particle stiffness show less significant to negligible impact as compared to the friction factor.},

abstract = {Fundamental to our understanding of erosional and transport phenomena in earth-surface dynamics and engineering is knowledge of the conditions under which sediment motion will begin when subjected to turbulent flow. The onset criterion currently in use emphasizes the time-averaged boundary shear stress and therefore is incapable of accounting for the fluctuating forces encountered in turbulent flows. We have validated through laboratory experiments and analytical formulation of the problem a criterion based upon the impulse imparted to a sediment grain. We demonstrate that in addition to the magnitude of the instantaneous turbulent forces applied on a sediment grain, the duration of these turbulent forces is also important in determining the sediment grain's threshold of motion, and that their product, or impulse, is better suited for specifying such conditions.},

abstract = {We provide a probabilistic definition of the bed load sediment flux. In treating particle positions and motions as stochastic quantities, a flux form of the Master equation (a general expression of conservation) reveals that the volumetric flux involves an advective part equal to the product of an average particle velocity and the particle activity (the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area), and a diffusive part involving the gradient of the product of the particle activity and a diffusivity that arises from the second moment of the probability density function of particle displacements. Gradients in the activity, instantaneous or time-averaged, therefore effect a particle flux. Time-averaged descriptions of the flux involve averaged products of the particle activity, the particle velocity and the diffusivity; the significance of these products depends on the scale of averaging. The flux form of the Exner equation looks like a Fokker-Planck equation (an advection-diffusion form of the Master equation). The entrainment form of the Exner equation similarly involves advective and diffusive terms, but because it is based on the joint probability density function of particle hop distances and associated travel times, this form involves a time derivative term that represents a lag effect associated with the exchange of particles between the static and active states. The formulation is consistent with experimental measurements and simulations of particle motions reported in companion papers.},

abstract = {In natural flows, bed sediment particles are entrained and moved by the fluctuating forces, such as lift and drag, exerted by the overlying flow on the particles. To develop a better understanding of these forces and the relation of the forces to the local flow, the downstream and vertical components of force on near-bed fixed particles and of fluid velocity above or in front of them were measured synchronously at turbulence-resolving frequencies (200 or 500 Hz) in a laboratory flume. Measurements were made for a spherical test particle fixed at various heights above a smooth bed, above a smooth bed downstream of a downstream-facing step, and in a gravel bed of similarly sized particles as well as for a cubical test particle and 7 natural particles above a smooth bed. Horizontal force was well correlated with downstream velocity and not correlated with vertical velocity or vertical momentum flux. The standard drag formula worked well to predict the horizontal force, but the required value of the drag coefficient was significantly higher than generally used to model bed load motion. For the spheres, cubes, and natural particles, average drag coefficients were found to be 0.76, 1.36, and 0.91, respectively. For comparison, the drag coefficient for a sphere settling in still water at similar particle Reynolds numbers is only about 0.4. The variability of the horizontal force relative to its mean was strongly increased by the presence of the step and the gravel bed. Peak deviations were about 30{\%} of the mean force for the sphere over the smooth bed, about twice the mean with the step, and 4 times it for the sphere protruding roughly half its diameter above the gravel bed. Vertical force correlated poorly with downstream velocity, vertical velocity, and vertical momentum flux whether measured over or ahead of the test particle. Typical formulas for shear-induced lift based on Bernoulli's principle poorly predict the vertical forces on near-bed particles. The measurements suggest that particle-scale pressure variations associated with turbulence are significant in the particle momentum balance.},

abstract = {Ideas deriving from the standard formulation for continuous time random walk (CTRW) based on the Montroll-Weiss Master Equation (ME) have been recently applied to transport and diffusion of river tracer pebbles. CTRW, accompanied by appropriate probability density functions (PDFs) for walker step length and waiting time, yields asymptotically the standard advection-diffusion equation (ADE) for thin-tailed PDFs and the fractional advection-diffusion equation (fADE) for heavy-tailed PDFs, the latter allowing the possibilities of subdiffusion or superdiffusion. Here we show that the CTRW ME is inappropriate for river pebbles moving as bed load: a deposited particle raises local bed elevation, and an entrained particle lowers it so that particles interact with the lattice of the sediment-water interface. We use the Parker-Paola-Leclair framework, which is a probabilistic formulation of the Exner equation of sediment conservation, to develop a new ME for tracer transport and dispersion for alluvial morphodynamics. The formulation is based on the existence of a mean bed elevation averaged over fluctuations. The new ME yields asymptotic forms for ADE and fADE that differ significantly from CTRW. It allows vertical as well as streamwise advection-diffusion. Vertical dispersion is nonlocal but cannot be expressed with fractional derivatives. In order to illustrate the new model, we apply it to the restricted case of vertical dispersion only, with both thin and heavy tails for relevant PDFs. Vertical dispersion shows a subdiffusive behavior.},

abstract = {Meandering rivers are common on Earth and other planetary surfaces, yet the conditions necessary to maintain meandering channels are unclear. As a consequence, self-maintaining meandering channels with cutoffs have not been reproduced in the laboratory. Such experimental channels are needed to explore mechanisms controlling migration rate, sinuosity, floodplain formation, and planform morphodynamics and to test theories for wavelength and bend propagation. Here we report an experiment in which meandering with near-constant width was maintained during repeated cutoff and regeneration of meander bends. We found that elevated bank strength (provided by alfalfa sprouts) relative to the cohesionless bed material and the blocking of troughs (chutes) in the lee of point bars via suspended sediment deposition were the necessary ingredients to successful meandering. Varying flood discharge was not necessary. Scaling analysis shows that the experimental meander migration was fast compared to most natural channels. This high migration rate caused nearly all of the bedload sediment to exchange laterally, such that bar growth was primarily dependent on bank sediment supplied from upstream lateral migration. The high migration rate may have contributed to the relatively low sinuosity of 1.19, and this suggests that to obtain much higher sinuosity experiments at this scale may have to be conducted for several years. Although patience is required to evolve them, these experimental channels offer the opportunity to explore several fundamental issues about river morphodynamics. Our results also suggest that sand supply may be an essential control in restoring self-maintaining, actively shifting gravel-bedded meanders.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the role of turbulence fluctuations on the entrainment of a fully exposed grain near threshold flow conditions. Experiments were carried out to measure synchronously the near bed flow velocity and the particle movement for a range of flow conditions and resulting particle entrainment frequencies. We used a simplified bed geometry consisted of spherical particles to reduce the complexities associated with the variations in the bed and flow details in an effort to identify the underlying dominant physical mechanism. An analysis was performed based on common force approximations using near bed flow velocity. Turbulence fluctuations were treated as impulses, which are products of magnitude and duration of applied force. It is demonstrated that besides the magnitude of the instantaneous forces applied on a sediment grain, their duration is important as well in determining whether a particle will be entrained by a turbulent flow event. Frequency of particle entrainment varied remarkably with minute changes in gross flow parameters. Impulse imparted on the sediment grain by turbulent flow was found to be well represented by a log-normal distribution. We obtained a (log-normal) probability density function (pdf) dependent on only the coefficient of variation of the impulse (impulse intensity). Relation of the impulse intensity to the particle Reynolds number, Re∗, was established. The sensitivity of the computed impulse to the critical force level, as well as the influence of the critical impulse level on the dislodgement events, was explored. Particle entrainment probabilities were found using the derived pdf as well as experimental observations and a good agreement between the two is reported. Implications of the presented impulse concept and our experimental findings for sediment mobility at low bed shear stress conditions are also discussed.},

abstract = {A 524-km reach of Fraser River, British Columbia, was traversed, where the channel alternates between gravel-bedded reaches that are incised into semiconsolidated glacial deposits and bedrock-bound reaches, including Fraser Canyon. Continuous centerline acoustic Doppler current proﬁler survey and observations of bedrock conﬁnement, supplemented with measurements on air photos, reveal the inﬂuence of bedrock on channel properties. The surveyed reach was subdivided into 10 morphological reaches, ranging from dominance by alluvial gravel-bed channels to dominantly rock-walled canyons. Measured data were grouped within each reach based on the presence of bedrock on both banks, one bank, or neither bank. From alluvial to mixed to canyon-dominated reaches, river widths decreased while water depths, ﬂow velocities, water surface slopes, and bed shear stresses increased. Within reaches, subreaches with bedrock on both banks were narrower and deeper with higher bed shear stresses but, at the observed stage, had lower depth-averaged velocity and water surface slope than partly conﬁned and alluvial (unconﬁned) subreaches. A conceptual model is presented representing a bedrock river as an alternating series of relatively low gradient, deep, rock-walled pools and steep semialluvial or alluvial sections. Downstream hydraulic geometry relations have scaling exponents expected for alluvial channels provided that the alluvial and rock-inﬂuenced sections are analyzed separately. In Fraser River, canyons become relatively narrower downstream, apparently in response to increasing rock uplift during the Quaternary period. The observations are compared against prior semitheoretical frameworks established to explain variations in width, slope, and channel shape along rockbound channels.},

abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments demonstrates that riparian vegetation can cause a braided channel to self-organize to, and maintain, a dynamic, single-thread channel. The initial condition for the experiments was steady-state braiding in non-cohesive sand under uniform discharge. From here, an experiment consisted of repeated cycles alternating a short duration high flow with a long duration low flow, and uniform dispersal of alfalfa seeds over the bed at the end of each high flow. Plants established on freshly deposited bars and areas of braidplain that were unoccupied during low flow. The presence of the plants had the effect of progressively focusing the high flow so that a single dominant channel developed. The single-thread channel self-adjusted to carry the high flow. Vegetation also slowed the rate of bank erosion. Matching of deposition along the point bar with erosion along the outer bend enabled the channel to develop sinuosity and migrate laterally while suppressing channel splitting and the creation of new channel width. The experimental channels spontaneously reproduced many of the mechanisms by which natural meandering channels migrate and maintain a single dominant channel, in particular bend growth and channel cutoff. In contrast with the braided system, where channel switching is a nearly continuous process, vegetation maintained a coherent channel until wholesale diversion of flow via cutoff and/or avulsion occurred, by which point the previous channel tended to be highly unfavorable for flow. Thus vegetation discouraged the coexistence of multiple channels. Varying discharge was key to allowing expression of feedbacks between the plants and the flow and promoting the transition from braiding to a single-thread channel that was then dynamically maintained.},

abstract = {In a turbulent wall shear flow, we explore, for the first time, the stochastic mechanics of loose boundary particle transport, having variable particle protrusions due to various cohesionless particle packing densities. The mean transport probabilities in contact and detachment modes are obtained. The mean transport probabilities in these modes as a function of Shields number (nondimensional fluid induced shear stress at the boundary) for different relative particle sizes (ratio of boundary roughness height to target particle diameter) and shear Reynolds numbers (ratio of fluid inertia to viscous damping) are presented. The transport probability in contact mode increases with an increase in Shields number attaining a peak and then decreases, while that in detachment mode increases monotonically. For the hydraulically transitional and rough flow regimes, the transport probability curves in contact mode for a given relative particle size of greater than or equal to unity attain their peaks corresponding to ...},

abstract = {Granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and important in various applications such as road and railway engineering. Granular materials exhibit complicated mechanical behaviors, which are affected significantly by the irregular shape of particles. Currently, the discrete element method (DEM) has been accepted as an effective approach to investigate the mechanical behaviors of granular materials. However, there are scarce simulations based on DEM in literatures considering the irregularity of particle shape. A new method is proposed to simulate individual real particle with irregular shape using clump constituted by overlapping spheres. First, the geometric model of real particle with surface nodes and inner nodes is established through digitally processing the computerized tomography (CT) scanning data. Second, a clump consisting of spheres is generated to simulate the real particle using a minimum distance criterion. The criterion is implemented by tree optimization algorithm. Influential factors are also introduced to balance the model accuracy and computing cost. Effects of the influential factors, including the density of geometric grid and the minimum distance, on simulations are discussed. Results show that this new method is simpler and more efficient than the previous methods in terms of the model accuracy and computing cost.},

@article{Murray2003,
abstract = {Numerical models in geomorphology and geophysics can be arranged along a continuum with 'simulation models' at one end and highly simplified, 'exploratory models' at the other. Simulation models are designed to reproduce a natural system as completely as possible; to simulate as wide a range of behaviors, in as much detail, and with as much quantitative accuracy as can be achieved. To accomplish this goal, a modeler typically strives to include all the processes that could significantly affect the quantitative accuracy of the model, and typically treats the processes in as much detail as is practical. In this case, model evaluation naturally consists of quantitatively comparing predicted variable values to corresponding measurements made in the field or laboratory. At the other end of this model spectrum, exploratory models arise when trying to discover what processes or interactions produce some poorly understood phenomenon—when searching for the clearest, simplest explanation. In this case, a modeler strives to include as few processes as possible while reproducing the poorly understood aspects of the phenomenon in question, to find the essential mechanisms. In exploratory models, quantitative accuracy is not as important as simplifying the formalism to investigate the general features of the interactions and feedbacks capable of causing a poorly understood behavior; a quantitatively accurate match with a wide variety of observations may not be expected. As with simulation models, a quantitative match with specific observations may be achievable by tuning parameters and the form of model interactions. However, a better model-testing strategy in these cases involves robust predictions that do not depend on the details of the formal representations of processes in the model, but result inevitably from the most general aspects of the model interactions. Testing such predictions can falsify the basic hypotheses the model is designed to explore.},

abstract = {The distinct element method is a numerical model capable of describing the mechanical behaviour of assemblies of discs and spheres. The method is based on the use of an explicit numerical scheme in which the interaction of the particles is monitored contact by contact and the motion of the particles modelled particle by particle. The main features of the distinct element method are described. The method is validated by comparing force vector plots obtained from the computer program BALL with the corresponding plots obtained from a photoelastic analysis. The photoelastic analysis used for the comparison is the one applied to an assembly of discs by De Josselin de Jong and Verruijt (1969). The force vector diagrams obtained numerically closely resemble those obtained photoelastically. It is concluded from this comparison that the distinct element method and the program BALL are valid tools for research into the behaviour of granular assemblies.

abstract = {[1] We conducted a series of flume experiments to investigate the response of self-formed gravel-bed channels to floods of varying magnitude and duration. Floods were generated by increasing the discharge into a channel created in sand-and gravel-sized sediment with a median grain size of 2 mm. Flooding increased the Shields stress along the channel perimeter, causing bank erosion and rapid channel widening. The sediment introduced to the channel by bank erosion was not necessarily deposited on the channel bed, but was rather transported downstream, a process likely facilitated by transient fining of the bed surface. At the end of each experiment, bank sediments were no longer in motion, " partial bed load transport " characterized the flat-bed portion of the channel, and the Shields stress approached a constant value of 0.056, about 1.2 times the critical Shields stress for incipient motion. Furthermore, the discharge was entirely accommodated by flow within the channel: the creation of a stable channel entirely eliminated overbank flows. We speculate that similar processes may occur in nature, but only where bank sediments are non-cohesive and where channel-narrowing processes cannot counteract bank erosion during overbank flows. We also demonstrate that a simple model of lateral bed load transport can reproduce observed channel widening rates, suggesting that simple methods may be appropriate for predicting width increases in channels with non-cohesive, unvegetated banks, even during overbank flows. Last, we present a model for predicting the equilibrium width and depth of a stable gravel-bed channel with a known channel-forming Shields stress.},

abstract = {Travel distance and residence time probability distributions are the key components of stochastic models for coarse sediment transport. Residence time for individual grains is difficult to measure and residence time distributions appropriate to field and laboratory settings are typically inferred theoretically or from overall transport characteristics. However, bed elevation time series collected using sonar-transducers and LIDAR can be translated into empirical residence time distributions at each elevation in the bed and for the entire bed thickness. Sediment residence time at a given depth can be conceptualized as a stochastic return time process on a finite interval. Overall sediment residence time is an average of residence times at all depths weighted by the likelihood of deposition at each depth. Theory and experiment show that when tracers are seeded on the bed surface, power- law residence time will be observed until a timescale set by the bed thickness and bed fluctuation statistics. After this time, the long-time (global) residence time distribution will take exponential form. Crossover time is the time of transition from power-law to exponential behavior. The crossover time in flume studies can be on the order of seconds to minutes while that in rivers can be days to years.},

abstract = {In this work, a fully-coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and Discrete Element Method (DEM) are used to simulate a unidirectional turbulent open-channel flow over the full range of sediment transport regimes. The fluid and particles are computed on separate grids using a dual-grid formulation to maintain consistency and avoid instability issues. The results of coupling the dispersed phase to a multiphase flow solver that uses volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are compared to those obtained from coupling through drag to a single flow solver. The current work also examines the applicability and limitations of lumping particles as a representative particle to reduce the cost of simulations. Insight to the impact of different turbulent events to the entrainment of particles is also given. The simulation results of sediment transport from both coupling techniques show good agreement with empirical formulas in the bedload regime, but under-predict sediment transport in the suspended load regime. In the suspended load regime, using partial coupling, the rate of sediment transport was found to be under-predicted as compared to full-coupling. The deviation in results in the suspended load regime was found to increase with increases in the applied shear stress. Both coupling methods revealed the same effect on the friction factor where friction increases in the bedload regime and decreases in the suspended load regime reaching a maximum at the transition between regimes. This result is contrary to past studies which have shown a discrete jump in the friction factor at the transition. Lumping particles as representative particles is shown to reduce the simulation cost by more than a factor of 5 when using a scaling factor of 2. By doing a quadrant analysis on information obtained from particle and flow field results, it was found that most of the particles are entrained by more frequent sweep events.},

The particle saltation theoretical/numerical model follows a Lagrangian approach, and addresses the motion of sediment particles in an open channel flow described by a logarithmic velocity profile. The model is validated with experimental data obtained from the literature. In order to evaluate the importance of the phenomenon, simulations with and without particle-particle collisions were carried out. Results for two different sediment concentrations are presented, namely 0.13{\%} and 2.33{\%}. For each concentration of particles, three different flow intensities were considered, and trajectories of two different particle sizes, within the sand range were computed. Changes in particle rotation, particle velocity, and angle of trajectory before and after particle-particle collisions appear to be relatively important at lower shear stresses, whereas they decrease in significance with increasing flow intensities. Analyses of the evolution in time of the second order moment of particle location suggest that inter-particle collisions introduce transverse diffusion in saltating particles in the span-wise direction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Three tracer inventories were implemented in July 2008, 2009 and 2010. Recovery rates calculated for mobile tracers declined from 78{\%} in 2008 to 45{\%} in 2009 and 25{\%} in 2010. Observations of tracer displacement revealed very high sediment dispersion, with frontrunners having travelled more than 2 km only three months after their deployment. The declining recovery rate over time was interpreted as resulting from rapid dispersion rather than deep burial. We evaluated that 64{\%} of the tracers deployed in the active channel were exported from the 23-km study reach three years after the onset of the tracing experiment. Travel distances were characterized by right-skewed and heavy-tailed distributions, correctly fitted by a power-law function. This supports the idea that in gravel-bed rivers with abundant sediment supply relative to transport capacity, bedload transport can be viewed as a superdiffusive sediment dispersion process. It is also shown that tracers initially deployed in the low-flow channel were characterized by a 15- to 30-fold increase of mobility compared to tracers deployed in gravel bars.},

abstract = {Characteristics of turbulence structure in quasi-2D flows with static and weakly mobile gravel beds are presented. Three sets of measurements with acoustic Doppler velocimeters in an irrigation canal were used: two with subcritical bed shear stress (static beds) and one with the bed shear stress ?o close to critical ?oc (weakly mobile bed). The analyses included vertical distributions of local mean velocities, turbulence intensities, turbulent shear stresses, velocity auto- and cross-spectra, the quadrant method, and high-order velocity moments. A number of properties of turbulence intensities, high-order moments, streamwise bursting parameters, and velocity spectra appeared to be similar for all three flows, but some properties were different. The most important one was an observed reduction in the von Ka ´rma ´n constant for the flow with weakly mobile bed. Comparison of these results with other studies and analogies with drag-reducing flows suggest that at ?o /?oc ? 1 the drag on the bed for a given granular material should be minimized.},

The particles have a mobility below their nominal threshold of incipient motion and settle onto the rough bed that consists of a hexagonally packed layer of spheres with the same size. Conditioned averaging is employed to extract the characteristic features of an erosion event, defining a suitable criterion for detection and accounting for possible asymmetry of flow structures. The highly resolved dataset provides detailed insight into the key-mechanisms of erosion.

abstract = {This paper continues the investigation of the motion of solitary grains in a water stream, reported by Francis (1973). The trajectories of solid grains are photographed by a multi-exposure technique as they are propelled by water streams along the bed of a laboratory channel. Many thousands of photographs were taken and analysed to determine the positions, velocities and accelerations of the grain. The technique does not take into account the possible effect, in multi-grain transport, of inter? granular collisions. The three different modes of transport of grains were all observed - rolling, saltation and suspension, and the proportion of each found for a variety of transport stage u*ju*Q. The development of suspension is much less rapid than the development of saltation from rolling, but even at the highest stage used, about 3.0, there is still a small amount of rolling. The trajectory dimensions and geometry are shown in relation to the stage which uniquely determines the geometry. Experiments where the grain is suddenly entrained from a stationary position show that several features of the subsequent trajectory are the same as those of a trajectory with a prior history of movement: thus it is inferred that the start of a trajectory is by way of hydro- dynamic forces rather than by the conservation of momentum of previous trajectories. Impacts and trajectories were analysed for the coefficient of friction tan a and for the height of the effective thrust. While tan {\textless} x is shown to be rather larger than has been suspected in the past, the variation of throws light upon predominance of slow fluid near the bed rather than high speed inrushes of fast fluid. Better information is now available for finding the mean forward speed of grains compared to that presented in the earlier paper. There are grounds for believing the existence of a ‘ shear-drift' force on grains when they are in a velocity gradient, giving a force oppos? ing gravity: but there is no evidence of a proximity effect of the bed independent of the velocity gradien},

This is the followup paper to Francis (1973) which is probably the earliest photography based experiment resolving sediment transport characteristics in a water stream. The authors take many thousands of photos to obtain positions, velocities, and accelerations of bed and wash load particles within a flume. They discriminate position and velocity components into modes of motion (as in rolling, sliding, suspended). Wide variation is noted, but the dataset is too small to access distributions of velocity or acceleration. This paper is significant, but much like Shields (1936) its significance has become entirely historical as its database contribution is completely overshadowed by modern datasets (see Heyman et al.

Clusters are found to range in length from 0.11.2 m in a streamwise direction. Using flume experiments, it has been possible to simulate the formation of clusters resembling those found in natural channels. Observations of cluster formation indicate that these bedforms are developed during falling stage from flood discharges as particles are deposited around exceptionally large clasts which act as obstacles in the flow. Cluster bedforms play a significant role in sediment transport: they delay incipient motion and limit the availability of bed material for transportation.},

The influence of the maximum degree of SH functions and mesh fineness on the determination of size and shape descriptors of the particles are systematically investigated. Correlations between different shape descriptors of the studied sands are examined. Utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), a probabilistic approach considering both intrinsic and phenomenological correlations between SH coefficients is proposed to three-dimensionally regenerate the sand particles. Based on comprehensive and quantitative comparisons between the morphological characteristics of scanned and generated particles, we conclude that the proposed approach performs satisfactorily.},

abstract = {This study empirically quantified the effect of sampling time on measured transport rates and fitted rating curves based on results obtained from bed load traps deployed for 2, 10, and 60 min in a coarse-bedded stream. As expected for a skewed distribution of transport rates, 2 min deployment underpredicted transport rates obtained from 10 and 60 min deployment by factors of 2 and 3 at moderate flows (50-70{\%} Q(bkf)). At near-bank-full flow the underprediction by 2 min versus 10 min sampling increased to a factor of 5, while transport rates collected during 60 min deployments were reduced because of overfilled bags. At flows near incipient gravel motion, 2 min sampling overpredicted transport rates obtained by 10 and 60 min deployment by factors of 2.7 and 3.4. The overprediction is attributed to computational effects arising mainly from the lowest measurable transport rate for each sampling time. Rating curves fitted to transport rates from 2 min sampling were significantly less steep than those for longer deployment times. However, sampling time explains only a small degree of the large difference between rating curves from bed load traps and a Helley-Smith sampler (2 min sampling).},

When the mean sojourn time diverges the process is non-ergodic. In that case, the time average autocorrelation function is not equal to the ensemble averaged autocorrelation function, instead it remains random even in the limit of long measurement time. Several approximations for the distribution of this random autocorrelation function are obtained for different parameter ranges, and favorably compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Nonergodicity of the power spectrum of the process is briefly discussed, and a nonstationary Wiener-Khintchine theorem, relating the correlation functions and the power spectrum is presented.

abstract = {Previous analyses have identified the active width of braided rivers, the bed area over which bed load flux and short-term morphological change occurs, as an important element of braiding dynamics and predictions of bed load flux. Here we compare theoretical predictions of active width in gravel-bed braided rivers with observations from Sunwapta River, and from a generic physical model of gravel braided rivers, to provide general observations of the variation in active width, and to develop an understanding of the causes of variation. Bed topography was surveyed daily along a 150 m reach of the pro-glacial Sunwapta River for a total of four weeks during summer when flow was above threshold for morphological activity. In the laboratory, detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from photogrammetric survey at regular intervals during a constant discharge run. From the field and flume observations there is considerable local and circumstantial variation in active width, but also a general trend in average active width with increasing discharge. There is also a clear relationship of active width with active braiding index (number of active branches in the braided channel network), and with dimensionless stream power, which appears to be consistent across the range of data from field and physical models. Thus there is a link between active width and the river morphology and dynamics, and the possibility of a general relationship for estimating active width from channel pattern properties or reach-scale stream power values, from which approximate bedload flux calculations may be made. The analysis also raises questions about differences between hydraulically-based numerical model computations of instantaneous active width and observation of time-integrated morphological active width. Understanding these differences can give insight into the nature of bedload transport in braided rivers and the relationship to morphological processes of braiding.

Of these factors, bed shear stresses, across-particle differences in pressures$\backslash$n                              and fluxes of momentum, and sediment bed characteristics are found to be key factors in particle entrainment. The conventional$\backslash$n                              Shields entrainment parameter is shown to be applicable to averaged en masse entrainment by steady uniform 2-D flows. This$\backslash$n                              nondimensionalized bed shear stress at threshold is further demonstrated to be a function of interparticle forces and bed$\backslash$n                              normal hydrodynamic forces, and thereby sediment size and other fluid, sediment and bed characteristics.

Furthermore, dam reservoirs are used for recreation, navigation and they provide safety in the downstream valleys against extreme flood events and droughts. All reservoirs are subjected to sedimentation which, without adequate prevention and mitigation counter-measures, threatens their sustainability. As well as the evident loss of storage capacity, the adequate and safe operation of water intakes and bottom outlets belonging to the vital outlet structures can be affected by the deposition of sediments in the reservoir. This Vision Paper first addresses the state-of-the-art and the main scientific advances in terms of prevention and mitigation measures against sedimentation in reservoirs. Then, the main research challenges, which result from the assessment of what are the remaining open questions, are pointed out. The emerging research methodologies to study sedimentation processes are also discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s).The motion of bedload particles is diffusive and occurs within at least three scale ranges: local, intermediate and global, each of which with a distinctly different diffusion regime. However, these regimes, extensions of the scale ranges and boundaries between them remain to be better defined and quantified. These issues are explored using a Lagrangian model of saltating grains over the uniform fixed bed. The model combines deterministic particle motion dynamics with stochastic characteristics such as probability distributions of step lengths and resting times. Specifically, it is proposed that a memoryless exponential distribution is an appropriate model for the distribution of rest periods while the probability that a particle stops after a current jump follows a binomial distribution, which is a distribution with lack of memory as well. These distributions are incorporated in the deterministic Lagrangian model of saltating grains and extensive numerical simulations are conducted for the identification of the diffusive behavior of particles at different time scales. Based on the simulations and physical considerations, the local, intermediate, and global scale ranges are quantified and the transitions from one range to another are studied for a spectrum of motion parameters. The obtained results demonstrate that two different time scales should be considered for parameterization of diffusive behavior within intermediate and global scale ranges and for defining the local–intermediate and intermediate–global boundaries. The simulations highlight the importance of the distributions of the step lengths and resting times for the identification of the boundaries (or transition intervals) between the scale ranges.},

abstract = {Excess sediment production in the upper parts of catchments may result in important impacts over morphodynamics of gravel bed-rivers. By changing morphodynamics, sediment overfeed-ing may induce important changes in the structure of near-bed flow, mainly in what concerns exchange of momentum and mass between flow within the roughness elements and flow in the upper regions. It is not well-known how turbulent statistics, including those characterizing the bursting cycle, are affected by bed load transport, for mobile but geometrically similar beds. This study addresses this issue. It is aimed at evaluating the impacts of sediment transport on flow hydrodynamics, namely on statistics of turbulent coherent structures. In order to accomplish the proposed objective, laboratory tests were undertaken. Two-dimensional instantaneous flow velocity fields in the stream-wise and vertical directions were meas-ured with Particle Image Velocimetry. Two laboratory tests simulated a framework gravel bed with sand matrix and a framework gravel bed with sand matrix but with sediment transport imposed at near capacity conditions. The framework con-sists of coarse gravel whose diameters range between 0.5 cm and 7 cm and is kept immobile under the imposed flow conditions. The mobile sediments are sand with a mean diameter of 0.9 mm. For both tests, the quadrant threshold analysis technique was employed and shear stress distribution statistics were ana-lyzed and discussed in what concerns their contribution and persistence. In the case of mobile conditions, sweep events tend to govern the flow in the near-bed region. Relevant differences between mobile and sub-threshold beds are found in the wake of roughness elements, mostly for sweep statistics. In the presence of bed-load, ejection events decrease their participation in the shear stress production processes. This decrease in the ejection events contribution is partially balanced with an increase in the frequency of inward events. concluded that the presence of intense intermittent sediment transport increases the extreme values of shear stress while the flow becomes more organ-ized in the second and fourth quadrants, mainly increasing the importance of sweep events to tur-bulence production, while Ferreira et al. (2009) sug-gested that further research was needed to clarify the nature of feedback effects between turbulent flow organization and sediment fluxes. Fundamental questions remain unsolved in what concerns flow organization under sediment transport conditions, specially in ejections and sweep events which are the major contribuitors to the Reynolds shear stress production among the bursting cycle.

abstract = {It has been observed that the majority of particles in a granular material carries less than the average load and that the number of particles carrying larger than the average load decreases exponentially with increasing contact force. The particles carrying above average load appear to form a strong network of forces while the majority of particles belong to a weak network. The strong network of forces appear to have a spatial characteristic whereby the stronger forces are carried though chainlike particle groups referred to as force chains. There is a strong case for a connection between force chains of the discrete medium and the trajectory of the most compressive principal stress in its continuous idealization. While such properties seem obvious from descriptive analysis of physical and numerical experiments in granular media, progress in quantification of the force chain statistics requires an objective description of what constitutes a force chain. A procedure to quantify the occurrence of force chains is built on a proposed definition having two parts: first, the chain is a quasilinear arrangement of three or more particles, and second, along the chain, stress concentration within each grain is characterized by the vector delineating the most compressive principal stress. The procedure is incorporated into an algorithm that can be applied to large particle assemblies to compile force chain statistics. The procedure is demonstrated on a discrete element simulation of a rigid punch into a half space. It was found that only approximately half of the particles within the group of so-called strong network particles are part of force chains. Throughout deformation, the average length of force chains varied slightly but the number of force chains decreased as the punch advanced. The force chain lengths follow an exponential distribution. The procedure provides a tool for objective analysis of force chains, although future work is required to incorporate branching of force chains into the analysis.},

abstract = {Bedload, the transport of sediment remaining in contact with the stream bed, has mainly been studied from the perspective of the correlation between fluid driving forces and the responding sediment flux. Yet grain–grain interactions are important and bedload should also be considered as a granular phenomenon. We review progress made recently in the study of granular flows, especially on segregation and rheology, that better illuminates the nature of bedload. Granular flows may exhibit gas-like or fluid-like flow, or quasi-solid deformation. All three conditions might be duplicated in bedload. Understanding of intense bedload transport occurring continuously in a layer several grains deep – typical of sand beds – might greatly benefit from results in granular physics, as illustrated by grain-inspired bedload results. However, processes restricted to the surface of the bed, when particles move intermittently and the bed becomes structured, while characteristic in gravel-bed channels, are not well addressed in granular physics. Mutual study of these phenomena may benefit both physics and fluvial geomorphology. We intend, therefore, to contribute to an enhanced dialogue between granular physics and bedload science communities. Copyright {\textcopyright}2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Data from laboratory flumes and natural streams show that the critical Shields stress for initial sediment motion increases with channel slope, which indicates that particles of the same size are more stable on steeper slopes. This observation is contrary to standard models that predict reduced stability with increasing slope due to the added downstream gravitational force. Processes that might explain this discrepancy are explored using a simple force-balance model, including increased drag from channel walls and bed morphology, variable friction angles, grain emergence, flow aeration, and changes to the local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations. Surprisingly, increased drag due to changes in bed morphology does not appear to be the cause of the slope dependency because both the magnitude and trend of the critical Shields stress are similar for flume experiments and natural streams, and significant variations in bed morphology in flumes is unlikely. Instead, grain emergence and changes in local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations seem to be responsible for the slope dependency due to the coincident increase in the ratio of bed-roughness scale to flow depth (i.e., relative roughness). A model for the local velocity within the grain-roughness layer is proposed based on a 1-D eddy viscosity with wake mixing. In addition, the magnitude of near-bed turbulent fluctuations is shown to depend on the depth-averaged flow velocity and the relative roughness. Extension of the model to mixed grain sizes indicates that the coarser fraction becomes increasingly difficult to transport on steeper slopes.},

To generate a packing of 2D dense sample in a container of arbitrary shape, a number of key particle properties are identified as the targeted ones to reproduce, including the grain size distribution, density, particles orientations as well as specific shape characteristics of the particles. Four descriptors, including elongation, circularity, roundness, regularity, are chosen to characterize the particle shape. The considered container is discretized by a Voronoi tessellation with prescribed cell size and orientation distributions. Each Voronoi cell is then filledwith a particle with prescribed shape characteristics. Several algorithms are proposed and are compared in terms of their computational efficiency and accuracy to define the particle contours, to constrain the Voronoi tessellation and to fill the Voronoi cells with particles. Two examples are further employed to demonstrate the accuracy and the potential usefulness of the proposed method for a wide range of applications where discrete modelling of granular media is important. {\textcopyright}Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract = {Numerical models in geomorphology and geophysics can be arranged along a continuum with 'simulation models' at one end and highly simplified, 'exploratory models' at the other. Simulation models are designed to reproduce a natural system as completely as possible; to simulate as wide a range of behaviors, in as much detail, and with as much quantitative accuracy as can be achieved. To accomplish this goal, a modeler typically strives to include all the processes that could significantly affect the quantitative accuracy of the model, and typically treats the processes in as much detail as is practical. In this case, model evaluation naturally consists of quantitatively comparing predicted variable values to corresponding measurements made in the field or laboratory. At the other end of this model spectrum, exploratory models arise when trying to discover what processes or interactions produce some poorly understood phenomenon—when searching for the clearest, simplest explanation. In this case, a modeler strives to include as few processes as possible while reproducing the poorly understood aspects of the phenomenon in question, to find the essential mechanisms. In exploratory models, quantitative accuracy is not as important as simplifying the formalism to investigate the general features of the interactions and feedbacks capable of causing a poorly understood behavior; a quantitatively accurate match with a wide variety of observations may not be expected. As with simulation models, a quantitative match with specific observations may be achievable by tuning parameters and the form of model interactions. However, a better model-testing strategy in these cases involves robust predictions that do not depend on the details of the formal representations of processes in the model, but result inevitably from the most general aspects of the model interactions. Testing such predictions can falsify the basic hypotheses the model is designed to explore.},

At constant slope, the contribution of the rolling particles to the solid discharge only slightly differed when the particle supply was increased. At a slope of 10{\%}, it represented about 40{\%}. In contrast, rolling became the major regime when the slope increased, at a slope of 15{\%} it represented up to 80{\%} of the total solid discharge.},

abstract = {Bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers impacts channel stability, the lifespan of hydraulic structures, physical components of aquatic habitat, and long-term channel evolution. Field measurements of bedload transport are notoriously difficult, which precludes understanding many of the processes and mechanics associated with grain motion. Such uncertainties are exacerbated when using bedload transport equations, most of which were derived using data from a single river or set of laboratory flume experiments. Recently, laboratory experiments have focused on better quantifying the processes that impact bedload fluxes, which can then be used to improve sediment transport predictions. We highlight recent advances in laboratory instrumentation that can be used in bedload transport studies. In particular, more accurate ways to measure bedload fluxes, near-bed turbulence, bed grain sizes, and topography hold great promise. Laboratory experiments have also fundamentally improved our understanding of the influence of sediment supply and armoring processes on bedload fluxes and channel conditions. The importance of flow hydrographs in controlling total bedload transport rates and bedload hysteresis has also been demonstrated using flume experiments. Finally, many details about the mechanics of grain motion including flow turbulence, bed arrangement, and particle transport statistics are only possible through laboratory investigations, and we feature key knowledge gaps that can be improved with further study.},

abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between the statistics of bed load transport flux and the timescale over which it is sampled. A stochastic formulation is developed for the probability distribution function of bed load transport flux, based on the Ancey et al. (2008) theory. An analytical solution for the variance of bed load transport flux over differing sampling timescales is presented. The solution demonstrates that the timescale dependence of the variance of bed load transport flux reduces to a three-regime relation demarcated by an intermittency timescale (tI) and a memory timescale (tc). As the sampling timescale increases, this variance passes through an intermittent stage (≪tI), an invariant stage (tI {\textless} t {\textless} tc), and a memoryless stage (≫ tc). We propose a dimensionless number (Ra) to represent the relative strength of fluctuation, which provides a common ground for comparison of fluctuation strength among different experiments, as well as different sampling timescales for each experiment. Our analysis indicates that correlated motion and the discrete nature of bed load particles are responsible for this three-regime behavior. We use the data from three experiments with high temporal resolution of bed load transport flux to validate the proposed three-regime behavior. The theoretical solution for the variance agrees well with all three sets of experimental data. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the observed fluctuations of bed load transport flux over monosize/multiple-size grain beds, to the characterization of an inherent connection between short-term measurements and long-term statistics, and to the design of appropriate sampling strategies for bed load transport flux.},

abstract = {A model of sand transport in water is produced by combining a turbulence-resolving large eddy simulation (LES) with a discrete element model (DEM) prescribing the motion of individual grains of medium sand. The momentum effect of each particle on the fluid is calculated at the LES cell containing the particle, and the fluid velocity and pressure, interpolated to each particle center, is used to derive fluid force on each particle in the DEM. Eleven numerical experiments are conducted of an initially flat bed of particles. The experiments span a range of motion, from essentially no motion to vigorous suspension. Hydraulic roughness is found to increase abruptly at the transition from bed load to suspended load transport. Suspended sediment extracts momentum from the flow and decreases the rate of shear. Whereas, slightly higher in the flow, vertical drag by suspended grains damps turbulence and increases the rate of shear. Vertical sediment diffusivity and effective particle settling velocity are much smaller than is commonly assumed in suspended sediment models. The bed load experiments suggest that saltation by itself is a poor model of bed load sand transport. In contrast to expectations from saltation models, the peak bed load flux occurs at essentially the same level as the bed, and grains move slowly in frequent contact with other grains. Higher- and faster-moving bed load grains that can be considered to be in saltation represent a smaller portion of the total flux. Entrainment of bed load grains occurs in response to fluid penetration of the bed by high-vorticity turbulence structures embedded within broader high speed fluid regions referred to as a sweeps or high-speed wedges.},

abstract = {The occurrence of sufficiently energetic flow events characterized by impulses of varying magnitude is treated as a point process. It is hypothesized that the rare but extreme magnitude impulses are responsible for the removal of coarse grains from the bed matrix. This conjecture is investigated utilizing distributions from extreme value theory and a series of incipient motion experiments. The application of extreme value distributions is demonstrated for both the entire sets of impulses and the maxima above a sufficiently high impulse quantile. In particular, the Frechet distribution is associated with a power law relationship between the frequency of occurrence and magnitude of impulses. It provides a good fit to the flow impulses, having comparable performance to other distributions. Next, a more accurate modeling of the tail of the distribution of impulses is pursued, consistent with the observation that the majority of impulses above a critical value are directly linked to grain entrainments. The peaks over threshold method is implemented to extract conditional impulses in excess of a sufficiently high impulse level. The generalized Pareto distribution is fitted to the excess impulses, and parameters are estimated for various impulse thresholds and methods of estimation for all the experimental runs. Finally, the episodic character of individual grain mobilization is viewed as a survival process, interlinked to the extremal character of occurrence of impulses. The interarrival time of particle entrainment events is successfully modeled by the Weibull and exponential distributions, which belong to the family of extreme value distributions.},

A review of the basis for its formulation reveals, however, that an unnecessary bed roughness correction was applied to cases of plane-bed morphodynamic equilibrium. Its inclusion followed a flow resistance parameterization in tenus of the Nikuradse roughness height, which has been shown (well after the publication of their work) to be inappropriate for the characterization of mobile bed rough conditions in rivers. Removing the unnecessary correction and incorporating an improved correction of the boundary shear stress due to sidewall effects allow elucidation of the most parsimonious form of the bed-load relation of Meyer-Peter and Moller that is dictated by their own data set. The new predictor is presented in terms of two alternative power law forms. These amended forms show that, in the case of lower-regime plane-bed equilibrium transport of uniform bed sediment, the new estimates of volume bed-load transport rates are less than or equal to half the values that would be obtained with the original relation of Meyer-Peter and Moller in the absence of the unnecessary bed roughness correction. The meticulous database and clear analysis of the original work of Meyer-Peter and Moller greatly aided the present writers in their reanalysis, which liberally uses the hindsight offered by 58 years of subsequent research.},

abstract = {Non-Fickian (or anomalous) transport of contaminants has been observed at field and laboratory scales in a wide variety of porous and fractured geological formations. Over many years a basic challenge to the hydrology community has been to develop a theoretical framework that quantitatively accounts for this widespread phenomenon. Recently, continuous time random walk (CTRW) formulations have been demonstrated to provide general and effective means to quantify non-Fickian transport. We introduce and develop the CTRW framework from its conceptual picture of transport through its mathematical development to applications relevant to laboratory- and field-scale systems. The CTRW approach contrasts with ones used extensively on the basis of the advection-dispersion equation and use of upscaling, volume averaging, and homogenization. We examine the underlying assumptions, scope, and differences of these approaches, as well as stochastic formulations, relative to CTRW. We argue why these methods have not been successful in fitting actual measurements. The CTRW has now been developed within the framework of partial differential equations and has been generalized to apply to nonstationary domains and interactions with immobile states (matrix effects). We survey models based on multirate mass transfer (mobile-immobile) and fractional derivatives and show their connection as subsets within the CTRW framework.

abstract = {In soil-mantled steeplands, soil motions associated with creep, ravel, rain splash, soil slips, tree throw, and rodent activity are patchy and intermittent and involve widely varying travel distances. To describe the collective effect of these motions, we formulate a nonlocal expression for the soil flux. This probabilistic formulation involves upslope and downslope convolutions of land surface geometry to characterize motions in both directions, notably accommodating the bidirectional dispersal of material on gentle slopes as well as mostly downslope dispersal on steeper slopes, and it distinguishes between the mobilization of soil material and the effect of surface slope in giving a downslope bias to the dispersal of mobilized material. The formulation separates dispersal associated with intermittent surface motions from the slower bulk behavior associated with small-scale bioturbation and similar dilational processes operating mostly within the soil column. With a uniform rate of mobilization of soil material, the nearly parabolic form of a hillslope profile at steady state resembles a diffusive behavior. With a slope-dependent rate of mobilization, the steady state hillslope profile takes on a nonparabolic form where land surface elevation varies with downslope distance x as x(a) with a similar to 3/2, consistent with field observations and where the flux increases nonlinearly with increasing slope. The convolution description of the soil flux, when substituted into a suitable expression of conservation, yields a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and can be mapped to discrete particle models of hillslope behavior and descriptions of soil-grain transport by rain splash as a stochastic advection-dispersion process.},

abstract = {Mixtures of binary spheres are numerically simulated using a relaxation algorithm to investigate the effects of volume fraction and size ratio. A complete profile of the packing properties of binary spheres is given. The density curve with respect to the volume fraction has a triangular shape with a peak at 70{\%} large spheres. The density of the mixture increases with the size ratio, but the growth becomes slow in the case of a large size disparity. The volume fraction and size ratio effects are reflected in the height and movement, respectively, of specific peaks in the radial distribution functions. The structure of the mixture is further analyzed in terms of contact types, and the mean coordination number is demonstrated to be primarily affected by "large-small" contacts. A novel method for estimating the average relative excluded volume for binary spheres by weighting the percentages of contact types is proposed and extended to polydisperse packings of certain size distributions. The method can be applied to explain the density trends of polydisperse mixtures in disordered sphere systems.},

abstract = {A high-speed video system was used to study the interaction between sediment particles and turbulence in the wall region of an open channel flow with both smooth and transitionally rough beds. In smooth flows, particles immersed within the viscous sublayer were seen to accumulate along low-speed wall streaks; apparently due to the presence of quasi-streamwise vortices in the wall region. Larger particles did not tend to group along streaks, however their velocity was observed to respond to the streaky structure of the flow velocity in the wall region. In transitionally rough flows particle sorting was not observed. Coherent flow structures in the form of shear layers typically observed in the near-wall region interacted with sediment particles lying on the channel bottom, resulting in the particles being entrained into suspension. Although there has been some speculation that this process would not be effective in entraining particles totally immersed in the viscous sublayer, the results obtained demonstrate the opposite. The entrainment mechanism appears to be the same independent of the roughness condition of the bottom wall, smooth or transitionally rough. In the latter case, however, hiding effects tend to preclude the entrainment of particles with sizes finer than that of the roughness elements. The analysis of particle velocity during entrainment shows that the streamwise component tends to be much smaller than the local mean flow velocity, while the vertical component tends to be much larger than the local standard deviation of the vertical flow velocity fluctuations, which would indicate that such particles are responding to rather extreme flow ejection events.},

abstract = {Flow-competence assessments of floods have been based on the largest$\backslash$nparticle sizes transported, and yield either the mean flow stress,$\backslash$nmean velocity, or discharge per unit flow width. The use of extreme$\backslash$nparticle sizes has potential problems in that they may have been$\backslash$ntransported by debris flows rather than by the flood, it may be difficult$\backslash$nto locate the largest particles within the flood deposits, and there$\backslash$nare questions concerning how representative one or a few large particles$\backslash$nmight be of the transported sediments and therefore of the flood$\backslash$nhydraulics. Such problems would be eliminated for the most part if$\backslash$ncompetence evaluations are based on median grain sizes of transported$\backslash$nsediments, or perhaps on some coarse percentile that is established$\backslash$nby a reasonable number of grains. In order to examine such issues,$\backslash$nthe gravel-transport data of Milhous from Oak Creek, Oregon, and$\backslash$nof Carling from Great Eggleshope Beck, England, have been analysed$\backslash$nin terms of changing grain-size percentiles with varying flow stresses.$\backslash$nA comparison between these two data sets is of added interest because$\backslash$nthe bed material in Oak Creek is segregated into welldeveloped pavement$\backslash$nand subpavement layers, while such a layering of bed materials is$\backslash$nlargely absent in Great Eggleshope Beck.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe analyses show that the trend of increasing sizes of the largest$\backslash$nparticles in the bedload samples (diameter D,) with increasing flow$\backslash$nstresses is consistent with similar dependencies based on sieve percentiles$\backslash$nranging from the medians (D50) to the 95th percentiles (D,,). This$\backslash$nindicates that the largest particles are an integral part of the$\backslash$noverall distributions of bedload grain sizes, and respond to changing$\backslash$nflow hydraulics along with the rest of the size distribution. In$\backslash$nOak Creek, the median grain size shows the largest change with increasing$\backslash$nflow stresses, followed by Dso, and so on to D,, which shows the$\backslash$nsmallest change. The variations in D, continue this trend, and are$\backslash$nsimilar to those for D95. This systematic variation of grain-size$\backslash$npercentiles in Oak Creek is consistent with changes in the overall$\backslash$ndistributions which tend to be symmetrical and Gaussian for low discharges,$\backslash$nbut become skewed Rosin distributions for high discharges. In contrast,$\backslash$nin Great Eggleshope Beck the several percentiles and D, show the$\backslash$nsame rate of shift to coarser sizes as flow stresses increase. This$\backslash$nresults in part from differences in sampling techniques wherein the$\backslash$nbedload samples from Great Eggleshope Beck represent a complete flood$\backslash$nevent, while shorterterm samples at a specific flow stage were obtained$\backslash$nin Oak Creek. As a result of the integrated sampling in Great Eggleshope$\backslash$nBeck, the bedload grain-size distributions are more complex, commonly$\backslash$nwith a bimodal pattern. However, after accounting for differences$\backslash$nin sampling schemes in the two streams, contrasting patterns in changing$\backslash$ngrain-size distributions remain, and these are concluded to reflect$\backslash$ngrain sorting differences as the bedload grain-size distributions$\backslash$napproach the distributions of the bed materials. It is surprising$\backslash$nthat if criteria commonly employed to demonstrate the equal mobility$\backslash$nof different grain sizes are used in the comparison, then Great Eggleshope$\backslash$nBeck is far closer to this condition in spite of its minimal development$\backslash$nof a pavement. It is concluded that the respective shapes of the$\backslash$nbed-material grain-size distributions, in particular their degrees$\backslash$nof skewness, are more important to the observed sorting patterns$\backslash$nthan are the effects of a pavement layer regulating grain entrainment$\backslash$nto produce an equal mobility of different grain sizes. Therefore,$\backslash$nthe comparison has established that flow-competence relationships$\backslash$nwill differ from one stream to another, depending on the pattern$\backslash$nof grain sorting which is a function of the bedmaterial grain-size$\backslash$ndistribution.},

abstract = {The nature of the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n constant ($\kappa$), i.e. universal, Re-independent but wall-dependent or, in general, flow dependent, has been subjected to considerable investigation. Contradicting the classic view that $\kappa$ should be universal in open-channel flows of clear water with a fully developed boundary layer, irrespectively of the type of boundary, it has recently been proposed that the value of $\kappa$ is influenced by the mobility of the bottom boundary.Rather than advocating a particular view on the nature of $\kappa$, the objectives of this work are: (i) to provide a similarity framework for the nature of $\kappa$, highlighting, in the process, the underlying key phenomena at play, and (ii) to explore a theoretical model for $\kappa$ as a function of turbulence parameters.Dimensional analysis is performed, including a new key step, following the works of Selim Yalin, in which the shear-rate is interpreted as a two-phase variable, depending on flow as well as sediment parameters. Vaschy-Buckingham's theorem is applied and similarity arguments leading to the log-law are employed. These introduce appropriate hypothesis concerning complete and incomplete similarity, thus providing a theoretical framework for the discussion of the nature of $\kappa$. A theoretical model is then explored, materialised in a functional relation between $\kappa$ and turbulence parameters. The discussion of the nature of $\kappa$ becomes a discussion of the nature of those parameters, all susceptible to be measured. Such discussion is based on laboratory results concerning flows over porous immobile and mobile beds. The data reveals changes in the structure of turbulence for flows over weakly mobile gravel-sand beds but is not supportive of a reduction of the value of $\kappa$.},

abstract = {The bed material grain size distribution of gravel bed streams is often spatially heterogeneous. The heterogeneity is actually a random parameter, even for a '' well-mixed mixture,'' which potentially causes the transport rate for a given bed material to become an uncertain variable. The cause of bed material heterogeneity is the nonuniformity of the bed material, which is analyzed in this paper using examples from field observations and experimental data. The Monte Carlo simulation method is applied to study the uncertainty of the bedload transport rate using Wilcock's experimental data (P. R. Wilcock et al., 2001; P. R. Wilcock and J. C. Crowe, 2003). Each realization of the Monte Carlo simulation employed a randomly generated grain size distribution field for the entire simulation domain. With sufficient realizations the simulation results were adequate to show that the transport rates were a random variable and the mean transport rates did not fall on a single-valued curve when the local heterogeneity was taken into account. The results indicate that the bedload transport rate of nonuniform sediment has an intrinsic uncertainty that can result solely from the bed material. The results also partially account for the scatter of the fractional transport rate within Wilcock's experimental data. This study presents an important concept in understanding the uncertainty associated with estimates of sediment transport.},

abstract = {The laboratory experiments on sediment transport conducted by G. K. Gilbert differed importantly in technique from such studies of more recent date. Gilbert's flume was level and could not be altered in slope. Sediment was introduced at the upper end at a predetermined rate and by deposition built a bed gradient sufficient to transport the introduced load. The adjustment of slope in Gilbert's flume has contributed to the idea widely held by geologists that a river achieves equilibrium by adjustingits slope to provide just the velocity required for the transportation of the supplied load. In fact, slope adjusts but little to a change in amount of introduced sediment load. The adjustment takes place principally among other hydraulic factors: width, depth, velocity, bed forms, channel pattern, and pool-riffle sequence. Gilbert sensed this complicated adjustment process, but its details are as yet only partially known in quantitative terms.},

abstract = {Field observations in streams with beds of coarse sand and fine gravel have revealed that bedload moves primarily as thin, migrating accumulations of sediment, and coarse grains cluster at their leading edge. These accumulations are one or two coarse grains high and are much longer (0.2-0.6 m long in sand; 0.5-2.0 m in fine gravel) than their height. We propose the term "bedload sheet" for these features, and we argue that they result from an instability inherent to bedload movement of moderately and poorly sorted sediment. In essence, coarse particles in the bedload slow or stop each other, trap finer particles in their interstices, and thus cause the coarse particles to become mobile again. Bedload sheets develop on the stoss side of dunes, causing the dune to advance incrementally with the arrival of each sheet. Successive deposition of coarse sediment from the leading edge followed by fine sediment may generate the grain-size sorting that distinguishes cross-bedding. Available flume experiments and field observations indicate that bedload sheets are a common, but generally unrecognized, feature of heterogeneous sediment transport.},

abstract = {[1] Sediment transport is an intrinsically stochastic process, and measurement of bed load in the environment is further complicated by the unsteady nature of river flooding. Here we present a methodology for analyzing sediment tracer data with unsteady forcing. We define a dimensionless impulse by integrating the cumulative excess shear velocity for the duration of measurement, normalized by grain size. We analyze the dispersion of a plume of cobble tracers in a very flashy stream over two years. The mean and variance of transport distance collapse onto well-defined linear and power-law relations, respectively, when plotted against cumulative dimensionless impulse. Data suggest that the asymptotic limit of bed load tracer dispersion is superdiffusive, in line with a broad class of geophysical flows exhibiting strong directional asymmetry (advection), thin-tailed step lengths and heavy-tailed waiting times. The impulse framework justifies the use of quasi-steady flow approximations for long-term river evolution modeling.},

abstract = {Understanding bed load transport fluctuations in rivers is crucial for development of a transport theory and for choosing a sampling interval for "mean'' transport rates. Field-scale studies lack sufficient resolution to statistically characterize these fluctuations, while laboratory experiments are limited in scale and hence cannot be directly compared to field cases. Here we use a natural-scale laboratory channel to examine bed load transport fluctuations in a heterogeneous gravel substrate under normal flow conditions. The novelty of our approach is the application of a geometrical/statistical formalism (called the multifractal formalism), which allows characterization of the "roughness'' of the series (depicting the average strength of local abrupt fluctuations in the signal) and the "intermittency'' (depicting the temporal heterogeneity of fluctuations of different strength). We document a rougher and more intermittent behavior in bed load sediment transport series at low-discharge conditions, transitioning to a smoother and less intermittent behavior at high-discharge conditions. We derive an expression for the dependence of the probability distribution of bed load sediment transport rates on sampling interval. Our findings are consistent with field observations demonstrating that mean bed load sediment transport rate decreases with sampling time at low-transport conditions and increases with sampling time at high-transport conditions. Simultaneous measurement of bed elevation suggests that the statistics of sediment transport fluctuations are related to the statistics of bed topography.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. The containment of genetically modified (GM) pollen is an issue of significant concern for many countries. For crops that are bee-pollinated, model predictions of outcrossing rates depend on the movement hypothesis used for the pollinators. Previous work studying pollen spread by honeybees, the most important pollinator worldwide, was based on the assumption that honeybee movement can be well approximated by Brownian motion. A number of recent studies, however, suggest that pollinating insects such as bees perform L{\'{e}}vy flights in their search for food. Such flight patterns yield much larger rates of spread, and so the Brownian motion assumption might significantly underestimate the risk associated with GM pollen outcrossing in conventional crops. In this work, we propose a mechanistic model for pollen dispersal in which the bees performtruncated L{\'{e}}vy flights. This assumption leads to a fractional- order diffusion model for pollen that can be tuned to model motion ranging from pure Brownian to pure L{\'{e}}vy. We parametrize our new model by taking the samepollen dispersal dataset used in Brownianmotionmodelling studies. By numerically solving themodel equations,we showthat the isolation distances required to keep outcrossing levels belowa certain threshold are substantially increased by comparison with the original predictions, suggesting that isolation distances may need to be much larger than originally thought.},

abstract = {It has been known for a long time that sediment transport rates can vary strongly even if the ambient hydraulic conditions remain steady. In this article, a new approach is described to derive probability distributions of bed load transport rates, starting from the waiting time between the arrivals of individual sediment particles. The formalism should be valid when transport is not dominated by bed form motion. Without any assumptions about the distribution of interarrival times, the approach yields the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, a two-parameter distribution previously used in lifetime modeling. Observed dependence of mean transport rates on the sampling time and multiscaling are predicted by the distribution. Assuming exponentially and Poisson-distributed interarrival times, the same approach yields the Poisson and the gamma distributions. Using a high-resolution bed load transport data set from the Pitzbach, Austria, the distribution functions are tested on field data. The gamma distribution best describes the data, with maximum deviations of similar to 5{\%}. However, the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution may be more useful in certain applications, as it is a general approximation in the proposed formalism and no debated assumptions are necessary for its derivation.},

However, heavy-tailed resting times have never been directly observed in the field over multiple floods. Using 9 years of data from a large bed load tracer experiment, I show that the spatial variance of the tracer plume scales faster than linearly with integrated excess stream power, indicating anomalous superdiffusion. The superdiffusion is caused by a heavy-tailed distribution of observed storage times that is fit with a truncated Pareto distribution with a tail parameter that is predicted by anomalous diffusion theory. The heavy-tailed distribution of storage times causes the tracer virtual velocity to slow over time, indicated by a sublinear increase in the mean displacement that is predicted by the storage time distribution tail parameter.},

abstract = {Previous analyses have identified the active width of braided rivers, the bed area over which bed load flux and short-term morphological change occurs, as an important element of braiding dynamics and predictions of bed load flux. Here we compare theoretical predictions of active width in gravel-bed braided rivers with observations from Sunwapta River, and from a generic physical model of gravel braided rivers, to provide general observations of the variation in active width, and to develop an understanding of the causes of variation. Bed topography was surveyed daily along a 150 m reach of the pro-glacial Sunwapta River for a total of four weeks during summer when flow was above threshold for morphological activity. In the laboratory, detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from photogrammetric survey at regular intervals during a constant discharge run. From the field and flume observations there is considerable local and circumstantial variation in active width, but also a general trend in average active width with increasing discharge. There is also a clear relationship of active width with active braiding index (number of active branches in the braided channel network), and with dimensionless stream power, which appears to be consistent across the range of data from field and physical models. Thus there is a link between active width and the river morphology and dynamics, and the possibility of a general relationship for estimating active width from channel pattern properties or reach-scale stream power values, from which approximate bedload flux calculations may be made. The analysis also raises questions about differences between hydraulically-based numerical model computations of instantaneous active width and observation of time-integrated morphological active width. Understanding these differences can give insight into the nature of bedload transport in braided rivers and the relationship to morphological processes of braiding.

abstract = {The occurrence of sufficiently energetic flow events characterized by impulses of varying magnitude is treated as a point process. It is hypothesized that the rare but extreme magnitude impulses are responsible for the removal of coarse grains from the bed matrix. This conjecture is investigated utilizing distributions from extreme value theory and a series of incipient motion experiments. The application of extreme value distributions is demonstrated for both the entire sets of impulses and the maxima above a sufficiently high impulse quantile. In particular, the Frechet distribution is associated with a power law relationship between the frequency of occurrence and magnitude of impulses. It provides a good fit to the flow impulses, having comparable performance to other distributions. Next, a more accurate modeling of the tail of the distribution of impulses is pursued, consistent with the observation that the majority of impulses above a critical value are directly linked to grain entrainments. The peaks over threshold method is implemented to extract conditional impulses in excess of a sufficiently high impulse level. The generalized Pareto distribution is fitted to the excess impulses, and parameters are estimated for various impulse thresholds and methods of estimation for all the experimental runs. Finally, the episodic character of individual grain mobilization is viewed as a survival process, interlinked to the extremal character of occurrence of impulses. The interarrival time of particle entrainment events is successfully modeled by the Weibull and exponential distributions, which belong to the family of extreme value distributions.},

abstract = {The bed material grain size distribution of gravel bed streams is often spatially heterogeneous. The heterogeneity is actually a random parameter, even for a '' well-mixed mixture,'' which potentially causes the transport rate for a given bed material to become an uncertain variable. The cause of bed material heterogeneity is the nonuniformity of the bed material, which is analyzed in this paper using examples from field observations and experimental data. The Monte Carlo simulation method is applied to study the uncertainty of the bedload transport rate using Wilcock's experimental data (P. R. Wilcock et al., 2001; P. R. Wilcock and J. C. Crowe, 2003). Each realization of the Monte Carlo simulation employed a randomly generated grain size distribution field for the entire simulation domain. With sufficient realizations the simulation results were adequate to show that the transport rates were a random variable and the mean transport rates did not fall on a single-valued curve when the local heterogeneity was taken into account. The results indicate that the bedload transport rate of nonuniform sediment has an intrinsic uncertainty that can result solely from the bed material. The results also partially account for the scatter of the fractional transport rate within Wilcock's experimental data. This study presents an important concept in understanding the uncertainty associated with estimates of sediment transport.},

abstract = {Characterizing the collective behavior of particle transport on the Earth surface is a key ingredient in describing landscape evolution. We seek equations that capture essential features of transport of an ensemble of particles on hillslopes, valleys, river channels, or river networks, such as mass conservation, superdiffusive spreading in flow fields with large velocity variation, or retardation due to particle trapping. Development of stochastic partial differential equations such as the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) begins with assumptions about the random behavior of a single particle: possible velocities it may experience in a flow field and the length of time it may be immobilized. When assumptions underlying the ADE are relaxed, a fractional ADE (fADE) can arise, with a non-integer-order derivative on time or space terms. Fractional ADEs are nonlocal; they describe transport affected by hydraulic conditions at a distance. Space fractional ADEs arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow field over the entire system. Time fractional ADEs arise as a result of power law particle residence time distributions and describe particle motion with memory in time. Here we present a phenomenological discussion of how particle transport behavior may be parsimoniously described by a fADE, consistent with evidence of superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior in natural and experimental systems.},

The image processing procedure is entirely presented. Experimental results, including the size, the position, the trajectory, the state of movement (rest, rolling, and saltation), and the neighborhood configuration of each bead, were compared with a previous one-size experiment. Analysis of the solid discharge along the vertical displayed only one peak of rolling in the two-size bed, whereas three peaks of rolling appeared in the one-size case due to a larger collective motion. The same contrast is evidenced in spatio-temporal diagrams where the two-size mixtures are characterized by the predominance of saltation and a smaller number of transitions between rest and rolling. The segregation of fine particles in a bed formed by larger particles was analyzed taking into account the neighborhood configurations.},

The characteristics of the vertical velocity profile of sediment particles in the sheetflow regime, which were reported in previous experiments, are reproduced well by the present simulation. Furthermore, the mechanism to determine the velocity profile of the sediment particles is clarified from the viewpoint of the granular material dynamics.

Several existing CFD-DEM solvers are applied in chemical engineering and mining industry. However, a robust CFD-DEM solver for the simulation of sediment transport is still desirable. In this work, the development of a three-dimensional, massively parallel, and open-source CFD-DEM solver SediFoam is detailed. This solver is built based on open-source solvers OpenFOAM and LAMMPS. OpenFOAM is a CFD toolbox that can perform three-dimensional fluid flow simulations on unstructured meshes; LAMMPS is a massively parallel DEM solver for molecular dynamics. Several validation tests of SediFoam are performed using cases of a wide range of complexities. The results obtained in the present simulations are consistent with those in the literature, which demonstrates the capability of SediFoam for sediment transport applications. In addition to the validation test, the parallel efficiency of SediFoam is studied to test the performance of the code for large-scale and complex simulations. The parallel efficiency tests show that the scalability of SediFoam is satisfactory in the simulations using up to O(107) particles.},

abstract = {Physical models of gravel braided rivers were used to investigate the adjustment of braiding intensity to step changes in channel-forming discharge and the mechanisms by which channel pattern adjustment and maintenance occurs. A braided channel developed at low discharge was subjected to two step increases in discharge between which the channel was given time to develop stable average braiding intensity in response to each steady discharge. Active (with visible bed material movement) and total channel networks were mapped throughout the experiment. Total braiding intensity exceeded active braiding intensity and both adjusted to a stable, average value at each discharge, indicating that channel pattern adjustment to total discharge involves both the active and the total network. Only portions of the total braided channel network developed at a given time, and it formed progressively by migration and avulsion of the (less extensive) active network. At equilibrium, the ratio of active to total braiding intensity stabilized at about 0.4. This stable value may increase with relative mobility of the bed material (stream power relative to grain size). The stable value was achieved via gradual increase of total braiding intensity while active braiding intensity adjusted very quickly to the increased flow. These adjustments are controlled by partial avulsion of the main active channel associated with changes in its sinuosity, and allocation of flow and bed load to secondary anabranches. Braided channel pattern dynamics is closely tied to, and explained by, the local dynamics and symmetry/asymmetry of bifurcations and avulsions.},

Hairpins can autogenerate to form packets that populate a significant fraction of the boundary layer, even at very high Reynolds numbers. The dynamics of packet formation and the ramifications of organization of coherent structures (hairpins or packets) into larger-scale structures are discussed. Evidence for a large-scale mechanism in the outer layer suggests that further organization of packets may occur on scales equal to and larger than the boundary layer thickness.},

abstract = {Bedload transport in poorly sorted gravel bed streams is considered. Bedload and typical bed material (subpavement) size distributions are observed to be similar; it follows that the coarse half of the subpavement moves through a reach at a rate near that of the fine half. Since coarser grains are intrinsically less mobile than fine grains, it follows that some mechanism must act to nearly equalize mobility. It is hypothesized that the pavement seen in gravel bed streams at low flow is in fact in place during typical transport events capable of moving all available sizes. This pavement can provide the equalizing mechanism by exposing proportionally more coarse grains to the flow. Field data are used to quantify this concept and to develop a predictive relation for river pavement. The model indicates that pavement should be absent in most sand bed streams, in agreement with observation.},

abstract = {Motion pictures taken at Duck Creek, a clear stream 6.5 m wide and 35 cm deep near Yinedale, Wyoming, provide detailed, quantitative information on both the modes of motion of individual bedload particles and the collective motions of large numbers of them. Bed shear stress was approximately 6 Pa (60 dyncs cm-2), which was about twice the threshold for movement of the 4 mm median diameter fine gravel bed material ; and transport was almost entirely as bedload. The displacements of individual particles occurred mainly by rolling of the majority of the particles and saltation of the smallest ones, and rarely by brief sliding of large, angular ones. Entrainment was principally by rollover of the larger particles and liftoff of the smaller ones, and infrequently by ejection caused by impacts, whereas distrainment was primarily by diminution of fluid forces in the case of rolling particles and by collisions with larger bed particles in the case of saltating ones. The displacement times averaged about 0.2-0.4 s and generally were much shorter than the intervening rcpose times. The collective motions of the particles were characterized by frequent, brief, localized, random sweep- transport events of very high rates of entrainment and transport, which in the aggregate transported approximately 70?4 of the total load moved. These events occurred 9 YO of the time at any particular point of the bed, lasted 1-2 s, affected areas typically 20--50 cm long by 10-20 cm wide, and involved bedload concentrations approximately 10 times greater than background. The distances travelled during displacements averaged about 15 times the particle diameter. Despite the differences in their dominant modes of movement, the 8- 16 mm particles typically travelled only about 30{\%} slower during displacement than the 2 4 mm ones, whose speeds averaged 21 cm s-'. Particles starting from the same point not only moved intermittently downstream but also dispersed both longitudinally and transversely, with diffusivities of 4.6 and 0.26 em's-', respectively. The bedload transport rates measured from the films were consistent with those determined conventionally with a bedload sampler. The 2-4 mm particles were entrained 6 times faster on finer areas of the bed, where 8-16 mm particles covered 6 {\%} of the surface area, than on coarser ones, where they covered 12 YOe, ven though 2 4 and 4-8 mm particles covered practically the same percentage areas in both cases. The 4-8 and 8-16 mm particles, in contrast, were cntrsined at the same rates in both cases. To within the statistical uncertainty, the rates of distrainment balanced the rates of entrainment for all three sizes, and were approximately proportional to the corresponding concentrations of bedload.},

We review here some prototypical examples, with an emphasis on {\{}$\backslash$em analytically-solvable{\}} situations. In particular, it has escaped attention till recently that the standard results for the long-time properties of such systems cannot be applied when unstable fixed points are crossed in the asymptotic regime. We show how calculations have to be modified to deal with these cases and present a few relevant applications -- the hypersensitive transport, the rocking ratchet, and the stochastic Stokes' drift. These results reinforce the impression that dichotomous noise can be put on a par with Gaussian white noise as far as obtaining analytical results is concerned. They convincingly illustrate the interplay between noise and nonlinearity in generating nontrivial behaviors of nonequilibrium systems and point to various practical applications.},

abstract = {In this work we incorporate the effect of near-bed coherent flow structures into the entrainment of randomly configured mixed-size sediments. The fourth-order Gram–Charlier type probability density function (GC pdf) of near-bed streamwise velocity is employed to account for the higher-order correlations associated with turbulent bursting. A compilation of the published data over a wide range of bed roughness is used to analyze the near-bed coherent flow structures, including the second-, third-, and fourth-order moments of velocity fluctuation (i.e., turbulence intensity, skewness, and flatness factors) required in the fourth-order GC pdf. An important result of this study is a set of quantitative relations used to predict these higher-order moments as a function of the roughness Reynolds number. The random grain protrusion is parameterized with the exposure and friction heights, and an existing probabilistic approach is used to correct the hiding effect of mixed-size sediment. The above factors are all incorporated into the formulation of entrainment (rolling and lifting) probabilities. As compared to the previous normal and lognormal models, the present results demonstrate significantly improved agreement with the observed data for the unisize and mixed-size sediments under partial- and full-transport conditions. The results also reveal that the third-order GC pdf can be used to approximate the fourth-order one for the fully rough beds, however, for smooth beds the fourth-order GC pdf should be used to adequately incorporate the effects of higher-order correlations. This paper offers some new insights into the processes of sediment entrainment.},

Rehabilitation of degraded systems and mitigation of impacts of ongoing stresses are needed to preserve ecosystem services and fisheries, and are of a high priority if the aquatic biodiversity of inland waters is to be conserved. A number of technical solutions for rehabilitation and mitigation are available to restore habitat diversity, provide for environmental flows and ensure longitudinal and lateral connectivity within such ecosystems. It is recommended that such methods are applied on a basin-wide scale but is recognized that more restricted sections of waterbodies may have to be targeted. Planning for rehabilitation projects needs to be carefully conceived with a clear statement of the objectives of the rehabilitation and selection of the methods to be used. The selection of appropiate methods for any particular waterbody depends on local social and economic conditions and priorities. Land tenure, local laws and the interests of other local stakeholders in the resource also need to be incorporated into rehabilitation plans. In international rivers and lakes rehabilitation plans may need negotiation and cooperation by all riparian states. After execution, rehabilitation projects should be carefully monitored as to their success in meeting the objectives and modified should they fail to achieve the expected results.},

abstract = {Recent studies have observed deviation from normal (Fickian) diffusion in sediment tracer dispersion that violates the assumption of statistical convergence to a Gaussian. Nikora et al. (2002) hypothesized that particle motion at short time scales is superdiffusive because of inertia, while long-time subdiffusion results from heavy-tailed rest durations between particle motions. Here we test this hypothesis with laboratory experiments that trace the motion of individual gravels under near-threshold intermittent bed load transport (0.027 {\textless} $\tau$* {\textless} 0.087). Particle behavior consists of two independent states: a mobile phase, in which indeed we find superdiffusive behavior, and an immobile phase, in which gravels distrained from the fluid remain stationary for long durations. Correlated grain motion can account for some but not all of the superdiffusive behavior for the mobile phase; invoking heterogeneity of grain size provides a plausible explanation for the rest. Grains that become immobile appear to stay at rest until the bed scours down to an elevation that exposes them to the flow. The return time distribution for bed scour is similar to the distribution of rest durations, and both have power law tails. Results provide a physical basis for scaling regimes of anomalous dispersion and the time scales that separate these regimes.},

abstract = {Discrete element modeling (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides an excellent platform to analyze fluid-particle systems. In all previous work, the fluid and particle systems are solved on a single grid. Contradictory requirements posed by resolution of fine scale fluid features such as turbulence, friction and heat transfer coefficient at immersed surfaces, and the resolution of important geometrical features, versus the necessity to maintain smoothness in particle solid fraction distribution on the chosen grid, often make single grid calculations untenable. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a novel two-grid technique in which a coarser particle grid is mapped on to a fine fluid grid. The technique uses suitable mappings to transfer fluid field variables from fluid-to-particle grid, and interphase transfer terms and void fractions from particle-to-fluid grid. The method is applied to a jetting fluidized bed of 750{\$}\mu{\$}m particles with a characteristic jet width of 1.6. mm. Results in the form of time-averaged void fractions and solid-velocity for two inlet jet velocities with single and multiple jets are compared to experiments. The results agree reasonably well with the experiments validating the two-grid approach for cases where single grid DEM-CFD would have been difficult to apply. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Gonzalez2017,
abstract = {At the smallest scales of sediment transport in rivers, the coherent structures of the turbulent boundary layer constitute the fundamental mechanisms of bedload transport, locally increasing the instantaneous hydrodynamic forces acting on sediment particles, and mobilizing them downstream. Near the critical threshold for initiating sediment motion, the interactions of the particles with these unsteady coherent structures and with other sedi-ment grains, produce localized transport events with brief episodes of collective motion occurring due to the near-bed velocity fluctuations. Simulations of these flows pose a significant challenge for numerical models aimed at capturing the physical processes and complex non-linear interactions that generate highly intermittent and self-similar bedload transport fluxes. In this investigation we carry out direct numerical simulations of the flow in a rectangular flat-bed channel, at a Reynolds number equal to Re = 3632, coupled with the discrete element method to simulate the dynamics of spherical particles near the bed. We perform two-way coupled Lagrangian simulations of 48,510 sediment particles, with 4851 fixed particles to account for bed roughness. Our simulations consider a total of eight different values of the non-dimensional Shields parameter to study the evolution of transport statistics. From the trajectory and velocity of each sediment particle, we compute the changes in the probability distribution functions of velocities, bed activity, and jump lengths as the Shields number increases. For the lower shear stresses, the intermittency of the global bedload transport flux is described by computing the singularity or multifr actal spectrum of transport, which also characterizes the widespread range of transport event magnitudes. These findings can help to identify the mechanisms of sediment transport at the particle scale. The statistical analysis can also be used as an ingredient to develop larger, upscaled models for predicting mean transport rates, considering the variability of entrainment and deposition that characterizes the transport near the threshold of motion.},

@article{Ling1995,
abstract = {Initiation of bed-load transport of uniform spherical sediment particles on a horizontal bed in an open-channel flow is studied. On the basis of micromechanical and fluid dynamical considerations, two separate criteria for the initiation of motion are derived: one for rolling and one for lifting. Fluid forces such as drag, shear lift, Magnus lift, and lift due to centrifugal force are included in the derivation. The formulation of the lift force is theoretical. No empirical coefficient is used other than the drag coefficient C d , which is well established in the literature. In the low particle Reynolds number regime, where u * d/{\$}\nu{\$} ≤ 1, the dimensionless stress required to initiate lifting is found to be much higher than that of rolling, the former substantially above the Shields' curve while the latter is substantially below it. The theory is compared with Vanoni's 1964 data, with meaningful results. For higher particle Reynolds number, where u * d /{\$}\nu{\$}{\textgreater}10, the dimensionless stress needed to initiate lifting is closer to that of rolling. The Shields' curve for the most part lies between the two theoretical thresholds.},

@article{doi:10.1086/626637,
abstract = { The relative importance in geomorphic processes of extreme or catastrophic events and more frequent events of smaller magnitude can be measured in terms of (1) the relative amounts of "work" done on the landscape and (2) in terms of the formation of specific features of the landscape. For many processes, above the level of competence, the rate of movement of material can be expressed as a power function of some stress, as for example, shear stress. Because the frequency distributions of the magnitudes of many natural events, such as floods, rainfall, and wind speeds, approximate log-normal distributions, the product of frequency and rate, a measure of the work performed by events having different frequencies and magnitudes will attain a maximum. The frequency at which this maximum occurs provides a measure of the level at which the largest portion of the total work is accomplished. Analysis of records of sediment transported by rivers indicates that the largest portion of the total load is carried by flows which occur on the average once or twice each year. As the variability of the flow increases and hence as the size of the drainage basin decreases, a larger percentage of the total load is carried by less frequent flows. In many basins 90 per cent of the sediment is removed by storm discharges which recur at least once every five years. Transport of sand and dust by wind in general follows the same laws. The extreme velocities associated with infrequent events are compensated for by their rarity, and it is found that the greatest bulk of sediment is transported by more moderate events. Many rivers are competent to erode both bed and banks during moderate flows. Observations of natural channels suggest that the channel shape as well as the dimensions of meandering rivers appear to be associated with flows at or near the bankfull stage. The fact that the bankfull stage recurs on the average once every year or two years indicates that these features of many alluvial rivers are controlled by these more frequent flows rather than by the rarer events of catastrophic magnitude. Because the equilibrium form of wind-blown dunes and of wave-formed beaches is quite unstable, the frequency of the events responsible for their form is less clearly definable. However, dune form and orientation are determined by both wind velocity and frequency. Similarly, a hypothetical example suggests that beach slope oscillates about a mean value related in part to wave characteristics generated by winds of moderate speed. Where stresses generated by frequent events are incompetent to transport available materials, less frequent ones of greater magnitude are obviously required. Closer observation of many geomorphic processes is required before the relative importance of different processes and of events of differing magnitude and frequency in the formation of given features of the landscape can be adequately evaluated. },

@article{Clark2015,
abstract = {To clarify the grain-scale mechanisms that control the onset and cessation of sediment transport, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of granular beds driven by a model hydrodynamic shear flow. We find a critical value for the Shields number (the nondimensional shear stress at the top of the granular bed) that separates flowing and static states, with a bed flow rate that is discontinuous at the critical value. The transition times between flowing and static states diverge as the system approaches the critical Shields number from above and below. Additionally we find that, for finite systems, the onset of flow occurs stochastically at supercritical Shields numbers. We show that the statistics of the Shields number at failure obey Weibullian weakest-link statistics, and that the onset of flow is caused by local grain rearrangements that give rise to additional rearrangements and then to continuous flow. Thus, the onset of motion is governed by the packing structure of the granular bed, even deep beneath the surface. Since the fluid dynamics is strongly coupled to the settling process and thus to the bed structure, this also suggests a strong feedback between the fluid dynamics and granular physics in bed mobilization.},

abstract = {The paper investigates stochastic processes forced by independent and identically distributed jumps occurring according to a Poisson process. The impact of different distributions of the jump amplitudes are analyzed for processes with linear drift. Exact expressions of the probability density functions are derived when jump amplitudes are distributed as exponential, gamma, and mixture of exponential distributions for both natural and reflecting boundary conditions. The mean level-crossing properties are studied in relation to the different jump amplitudes. As an example of application of the previous theoretical derivations, the role of different rainfall-depth distributions on an existing stochastic soil water balance model is analyzed. It is shown how the shape of distribution of daily rainfall depths plays a more relevant role on the soil moisture probability distribution as the rainfall frequency decreases, as predicted by future climatic scenarios.},
