letter -> paper -> study 


abstract:
"despite the significant ... "
say in a positive way
although significance has been recognized the current models do not incorporate
 
In this "study/paper" - kill the word letter



Intro:
"more or less" 
mixed results...
no more recent than recent
recent research yielded mixed results, some supporting nikora, and others not supporting

"several field studies" -> only two 
limited field studies and you forgot a period before Martin

letter shuold go away.

Bedload diffusion with burial...:

burial is rest, but a different kind of rest
need to clearly define burial as a different type of rest
modify to : "in this model, we consider burial to be a permanent condition"
"closely follows" -> "follows"
I am not copying Weiss

track down the word letter and kill it. 

plot of the burial
"the major difference is really on the origin" 
peak will decline and standard deviation will increase significantly

THiNK to strengthen the emphasis on the tendency toward a uniform distribution



Discussion:
change this section title to "Discussion"

"classic flume experiments based on visually tracking painted sediment" 
fix this sentence


permanent -> long-term
change permanent to long-term

In this letter, we develop

"Our four-range bedload diffusion model"

Don't ever use the word trapped in place of buried 
"bed load trapping processes are important" 
a lot of attention went to entrainment 
read carefully the trapping business and don't be confusing 

other processes trap sediment in the field .. 

trapping can be a result of burial, or the surface as a reduction in the shear stress, or sheltering between surface structures, don't need the detail of water flow changes

kill permanent again and put long term... 
wrap by developing this model 

be positive about this 
last paragraph say what you did
then say what you can do in the future 

"finally, ..." 
Our develop a model accounting for a long-term burial
for future work we see two major things that need to be taken into consideration

Conclusion:
good
